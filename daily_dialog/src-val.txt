I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? <&&&> Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . What do you think of this coffee table ? <&&&> It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room . <&&&> How about this one ? <&&&> Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean . <&&&> Alright , let's look at some others . <&&&> Look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive . I've heard that you provide very good service , so when I need a mover , I call you guys first . Good evening , sir . Are you Mr . Jim Stewart from the States ? I would like to order cable . <&&&> Sure , what package do you want ? <&&&> What kinds of packages do you offer ? <&&&> We have all kinds of movie channel packages . <&&&> What else do you have ? <&&&> There is a package for all sports channels . I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ? <&&&> That would be nice . How are you getting there ? <&&&> Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . <&&&> Oh , I'd much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ... Maintenance Department . May I come in ? <&&&> Come in , please . <&&&> Did you call us ? <&&&> Yes . The television is not working properly . <&&&> What's the problem ? <&&&> The remote control doesn't work . I turned on the television , but I can't change the channel . <&&&> Let me have a look . I think the batteries should be changed . Let me replace them with new ones . Now , it's working . Do you like shopping ? <&&&> Yeah . I go shopping once a week <&&&> Why don't you do your shopping at home ? <&&&> What do you mean ? I can't understand . <&&&> I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce . Bob , I'm really upset with you . What do you think of this coffee table ? How can I help you today ? <&&&> I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! <&&&> Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . <&&&> That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians ! <&&&> That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and one Russian . <&&&> Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . I'd like to have a berth ticket to Shanghai . <&&&> Which train do you want ? <&&&> The 19:00 train . <&&&> Sorry . There aren't any tickets available for the 19:00 train . <&&&> When is the next train to Shanghai ? <&&&> The next train will leave at 20 : O5 . <&&&> How much is the ticket ? <&&&> 180 yuan . <&&&> Here is 200 yuan . Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . <&&&> Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? <&&&> Yes , definitely . <&&&> They have moved to some other places long time ago . <&&&> Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China . <&&&> Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . <&&&> This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . <&&&> Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . <&&&> Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . Are you being served , Sir ? <&&&> No , not yet . I just want to hair cut . <&&&> Would you sit here , please ? How would you like it cut ? <&&&> I want it short . <&&&> What , your short already , sir . Where are you going this weekend ? <&&&> I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day . <&&&> So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ? <&&&> Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ? <&&&> Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel . <&&&> Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ? What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? <&&&> I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before . <&&&> Do you usually shower or take a bath ? Good morning . How can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to open a new account . <&&&> Have you filled out an application form ? <&&&> Yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? <&&&> Yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? <&&&> Yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? <&&&> Yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . <&&&> That's very convenient . <&&&> It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! <&&&> Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . <&&&> An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . Are you Elvin ? <&&&> Elvin Dixon . Who are you ? <&&&> I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed . <&&&> Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual . <&&&> It is ? Can I help you , ma'am . <&&&> Yes , will you keep our bags until 6 p . m . ? <&&&> Are you all our guests ? <&&&> Yes , we checked out just now . <&&&> Please fill in this form . Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . <&&&> It is true . I think we should change some policies . <&&&> Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . <&&&> Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . Are you paying in cash or by credit card ? <&&&> Cash . <&&&> Here's your key , sir . Room number 1405.The bellboy will take your luggage to your room . Have a pleasant stay ! Can we go to the beach on foot ? <&&&> Oh , it's too far to walk there.We can take a bus . How many orders do we still need to pack , Gale ? We've been packing all day . <&&&> We still have to do about ten more . <&&&> Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out . Welcome . May I help you ? I like your new skirt . <&&&> Do you think it fits me ? What have you been up to , Johnny ? <&&&> You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... <&&&> Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? <&&&> You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ? <&&&> Our school has a link on its website for apartments . <&&&> Can I share an apartment with someone ? <&&&> Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates . <&&&> Are apartments expensive in this city ? <&&&> Do you need a single apartment , or is this for two people ? <&&&> I want a two-bedroom apartment . <&&&> You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month . I would like to talk to you , if you have time . <&&&> What ’ s going on ? <&&&> I want to discuss some things about my lease . <&&&> What aren ’ t you too sure about ? <&&&> Can you tell me when my lease is up ? <&&&> Your lease is for three years . <&&&> If I ever decide to leave before the three years , will there be a problem ? Did you hear something ? <&&&> Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . <&&&> It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . <&&&> You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . <&&&> Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! <&&&> I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . <&&&> I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! <&&&> I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? <&&&> I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . <&&&> Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? <&&&> I don't know . <&&&> I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . <&&&> I have plenty of gas . Good coming . <&&&> Good coming . Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later . <&&&> Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished . You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say . It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it . <&&&> It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself . Hello , Wendy speaking . <&&&> Hi , Wendy . I ’ m Gerry . <&&&> Hi , Gerry . How can I help you ? <&&&> Is Marisa in ? <&&&> Yes . But she is very busy right now . Can you call her later ? <&&&> All right . I ’ ll call her later . <&&&> Thanks , bye bye . Is everything all right ? <&&&> Not at all . <&&&> What's the problem ? <&&&> Someone just robbed me . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> This guy just robbed me right on the street . <&&&> He didn't hurt you , did he ? <&&&> I'm okay . He just stole my things . <&&&> I'm so sorry . This is the last of the milk . <&&&> I know . I intend to go to the store today . <&&&> Would you get some of that new cereal we saw advertised on TV ? <&&&> Which one ? <&&&> You know ... the one with the silly ad about how vitamins jump up and down . Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! <&&&> Recently it's been pretty good , actually . <&&&> That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . <&&&> Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . <&&&> So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ? What can I do ? <&&&> Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . Have you every belonged to a political party ? <&&&> No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party . <&&&> Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ? <&&&> Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . <&&&> The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . <&&&> You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness Have you taken the written test yet ? <&&&> No , I haven't . <&&&> You should study before you take it . <&&&> I have been studying . <&&&> Why don't you take the test ? <&&&> Do you know if it costs any money to take it ? <&&&> Since you already paid for your permit , you don't have to pay again . <&&&> All right . Do you know if the test covers the whole book ? What will I earn per year in this job ? <&&&> You can expect to earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year . <&&&> Are we covered by a good benefits plan ? <&&&> The job has a menu plan where you are given a fixed amount of money and you choose what you most need in terms of benefits . <&&&> Can we take personal days off ? <&&&> You get 2 weeks paid vacation and an additional 10 days of sick leave . <&&&> What do you offer in terms of a retirement plan ? Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? <&&&> Yes . She believes everything about him . <&&&> How sweet . Good morning miss . Wang <&&&> Good morning Mr . Li <&&&> It ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ? <&&&> Oh . It ’ s a nice day indeed <&&&> I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat So , Emily , how was your day ? <&&&> I don't think you really want to hear about it . <&&&> It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . <&&&> To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! <&&&> Why ? What happened ? <&&&> Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! <&&&> That's not very fair . What did you do ? <&&&> There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . <&&&> Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? <&&&> He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! <&&&> Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? <&&&> I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! <&&&> Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? <&&&> Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . <&&&> That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . What should I get Uncle Teddy ? <&&&> You could get him a tie . <&&&> Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . <&&&> Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . <&&&> That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . <&&&> He would think you were crazy , Caroline . <&&&> Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . <&&&> How much do you want to spend ? <&&&> Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . <&&&> Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . <&&&> What should he have then ? <&&&> I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . <&&&> I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? Hello , I set up my laundry yesterday , are they being ready ? <&&&> They will be ready this afternoon . <&&&> Oh , no . I ’ m leaving for Japan at eleven this morning . <&&&> Is that right ? We are very sorry <&&&> I thought it the same day service . Anyway , please do a hurry . <&&&> I ’ m afraid ... be can returned by eleven o ’ clock . They must be your parents , what do they do ? I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . <&&&> It's no use arguing the toss . Excuse me . We ordered too much . May we take the food home ? <&&&> Yes , surely . <&&&> Do I have to pay extra charge for that ? <&&&> No , you don't . It is free of charge . <&&&> Well , then , will you put this and that into doggie bags ? <&&&> Certainly , would you wait for a few minutes ? <&&&> Thanks . Would you give me another favor ? Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? <&&&> I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out . <&&&> What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? <&&&> Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . May I help you ? <&&&> Could I check out this book ? <&&&> Let me see your library card . <&&&> I need to get one . This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . <&&&> You look a little lost , can I help you ? <&&&> Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . Something ’ s burning ? <&&&> Oh , my bread ! <&&&> Mm , I love burnt bread . <&&&> Curse this oven ! Curse it ! <&&&> But I prefer burnt bread . <&&&> Curse the worst oven in the world . Guess who I saw yesterday ? <&&&> I don't know . Who ? <&&&> Avril Lavigen ! <&&&> The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? <&&&> Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... <&&&> So you're a big fan , eh ? <&&&> Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too . <&&&> And she was in a movie once again , right ? <&&&> Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . <&&&> What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? <&&&> She looked sweeter than her pictures . She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog . <&&&> Cats chase mice , don't they ? <&&&> And bugs . They can catch anything . How do I know if there is a vacancy in a company ? <&&&> Easy . View the home page of the company , and see if they need staff . Many websites offer two-way service , such as job-hunting and talent hunting . <&&&> Which websites are most popular ? wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ? <&&&> the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each . <&&&> I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife . <&&&> absolutely . It is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day . <&&&> incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ? <&&&> oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one . <&&&> thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . <&&&> Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy . <&&&> oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? <&&&> Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? <&&&> I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . <&&&> Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? <&&&> Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . <&&&> That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? Excuse me , Professor , I have a problem and need to leave class early . <&&&> Why do you have to leave early ? <&&&> I am not feeling well . <&&&> Could you make it up by attending my other section this week ? <&&&> Yes , it's all taken care of . <&&&> Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes ? <&&&> I can stay a few more minutes . Hello ! Where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ? <&&&> Maybe you should look around for an outlet . <&&&> That is a wonderful idea . <&&&> Outlets have more reasonable prices . Can you tell me where I can park ? <&&&> Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile ? <&&&> I drive an automobile . <&&&> Fine . You can either park in the student lot or on the street . Do you know what a handicapped space is ? <&&&> Yes , I have seen those spots . <&&&> Well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? <&&&> I park in the evenings . <&&&> Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . Have you seen those signs ? Let's see if we can reach some sort of agreement over your curfew . <&&&> Okay . Everyone else's parents let them stay out until two or three in the morning . Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ? <&&&> Is there anything good playing ? <&&&> Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster . <&&&> Really ? I want to go , too . What's the time now ? <&&&> Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . <&&&> You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . <&&&> We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . <&&&> I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . <&&&> We need to find a good realtor . <&&&> Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . Can I take your drink order ? <&&&> Where is your wine list ? <&&&> The wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table . <&&&> Do you have any mixed drinks available here ? Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? <&&&> Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . <&&&> Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . Merry Christmas , Linda ! <&&&> Merry Christmas , Lee ! <&&&> Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it . Has the game started yet ? <&&&> Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . <&&&> Who's winning ? <&&&> The Bulls , of course ! Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? <&&&> You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . <&&&> Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? <&&&> No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . <&&&> Did you register yet ? <&&&> Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . <&&&> What classes do you think are still open ? <&&&> Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . <&&&> That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . <&&&> I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . <&&&> He does that ? May I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun . <&&&> How do you want to send it ? <&&&> I guess I'll send it by airmail . <&&&> Is there anything valuable ? <&&&> No , there are only some vases . <&&&> They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do . <&&&> Have you got boxes for sale ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Is it all right this time ? Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . Does it look like a good fit ? <&&&> It's definitely your size . <&&&> Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it . <&&&> How do you prefer to pay ? <&&&> Let me use my credit card . <&&&> Now , if you'll just sign here . <&&&> No problem . I ’ m sorry , Sam . I don ’ t want to foc-concert . <&&&> How about going to the theatre ? <&&&> I don ’ t like going to the theatre . May I help you ? <&&&> Is this the right counter for gloves ? <&&&> Yes , madam . What sort of gloves do you want ? <&&&> Well , let me see some of each . <&&&> Certainly . What size do you take ? <&&&> Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . <&&&> I think a six is your size . How do you like these ? I can recommend them , they're very reliable . Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . <&&&> I'm OK . <&&&> OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? <&&&> OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . <&&&> OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? <&&&> That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . <&&&> Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . <&&&> Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . <&&&> As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . <&&&> Carton ? <&&&> Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . <&&&> Could you use wooden cases instead ? <&&&> Why use wooden cases ? <&&&> I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . <&&&> Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . <&&&> All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . <&&&> You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? <&&&> Don't you know that ? It's all about new office rules . <&&&> What does it say ? <&&&> It says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . It might be the most terrible thing for you . <&&&> I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? <&&&> If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department . <&&&> But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? How large is the plant ? <&&&> It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . May I come in ? Have you washed any clothes yet ? <&&&> No , I've only washed my whites . <&&&> When you wash your dark clothes , can you put some of mine in ? <&&&> Sure . Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes ? Let me see . How much should I pay for you ? Can I help you ? <&&&> My wife and I want to go to Beijing for a tour . Can you arrange it ? <&&&> Yes , we can arrange that . <&&&> I'd like to know what kind of tour your travel agency has . <&&&> Our travel agency provides all kinds of tours , ranging from individual tour to group package tour . <&&&> Excellent . <&&&> When do you expect to come ? <&&&> September 28th . <&&&> What specific places do you wish to visit ? May I take your order now ? <&&&> Yes . Do you have any specials today ? How are your stocks doing , Jim ? <&&&> Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . <&&&> Yeah . I lost money investing in the Internet , too . <&&&> Just goes to show that you should buy companies , not ideas . <&&&> I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . <&&&> Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Frank ? <&&&> No , what happened ? My stomach's growling again ! Brooke , I have bad news . <&&&> What ! <&&&> I called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today . <&&&> Don't you dare tell me that ... <&&&> I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats . This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . <&&&> You look a little lost , can I help you ? <&&&> Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . <&&&> Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties . Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . <&&&> Sure that ’ s fine . <&&&> This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ? <&&&> Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? I really need to go shopping . <&&&> What do you need to buy ? <&&&> I need to look for a new bedroom set . <&&&> Where are you going to go look for one ? <&&&> I have absolutely no idea . <&&&> You don't know where you want to look for one ? <&&&> No , I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets . <&&&> Do you want to know where I got mine from ? <&&&> Yes , because I love yours . What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? <&&&> Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . <&&&> I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? <&&&> In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . <&&&> Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! <&&&> A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? <&&&> I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . <&&&> Exactly . <&&&> So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? It's time for your bath , young lady . <&&&> But , Mom , I'm not dirty . <&&&> You need a bath every day . <&&&> Why ? We have the orientation this afternoon . I feel dizzy and I have a headache . I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? <&&&> Sure . What's your room number , sir ? <&&&> It's 8736 . Here is my key card . <&&&> A minute , please . It's 6212 yuan all together . Tax included . <&&&> Can I pay with traveler's check ? <&&&> Sure . Can I have your passport , please ? <&&&> Here you are . Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? <&&&> No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . <&&&> I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . <&&&> Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . <&&&> I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . <&&&> I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . <&&&> It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . <&&&> Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . <&&&> Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . <&&&> What kind of food will they be serving ? <&&&> My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . <&&&> It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food . <&&&> I can hardly wait ! <&&&> Do you know the day they plan to open ? Did you get my email ? <&&&> I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> How did the business trip go ? <&&&> Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . Good morning , sir , Can I help you ? <&&&> I'm looking for a citizen for my wife's birthday . <&&&> Oh , we have many kinds.Do you like this design . What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? <&&&> Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . <&&&> I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? <&&&> In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . <&&&> Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! <&&&> A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? <&&&> I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . <&&&> Exactly . <&&&> So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? <&&&> They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . <&&&> In what way ? Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> I'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago . <&&&> OK , take a seat please , sir . First of all , can you show me your ID please ? <&&&> Sure . Here you are . <&&&> OK , could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ? <&&&> Of course , it's a soft leather one , you know , not a sports one that looks childish . <&&&> Mmm ... does it zip closed ? <&&&> No , it's straps closed , and it has a buckle in the front . <&&&> OK , can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ? <&&&> Oh , yeah , the brand name . <&&&> So what's it , sir ? <&&&> Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . Have you find any job that you are interested in ? <&&&> I ’ Ve only find a few openings in my field . <&&&> There ’ s not a very high demand for that kind of job , isn ’ t there ? <&&&> Unfortunately not . If I can ’ t find anything in that field , then I could also work in the marketing field . <&&&> That ’ s a good idea . You have plenty of experience in marketing , don ’ t you ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> By the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . <&&&> Really ? What is it ? Good morning ! May I help you ? <&&&> Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer . <&&&> Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ? <&&&> Furnished . <&&&> Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ? <&&&> No , not all summer . Just for six weeks . <&&&> I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . <&&&> My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ? Good morning madam . What can I get you ? <&&&> I ’ d like a coffee please . <&&&> Certainly madam , what kind of coffee would you like ? Jane , we are going to have a board meeting next Friday . Will you please arrange it for me ? <&&&> Certainly , Mr . Robert . But can I have your plan ? <&&&> Sure . Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . Hi , David ! What are you doing ? <&&&> Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ? <&&&> Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ... <&&&> Neither am I . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club . <&&&> Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in . <&&&> Well ... What are you interested in ? Did you enjoy your meal ? <&&&> Yes , we really enjoyed it . <&&&> May I interest you in some dessert ? <&&&> Yes , that sounds great . <&&&> Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials . <&&&> The apple crisp sounds great . <&&&> Since there are four of you , would you like to split a second dessert ? <&&&> Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ? We used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship . <&&&> What do you mean ? Can I see some men's watches ? <&&&> Of course . How about this one ? <&&&> What functions does this watch have ? <&&&> It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function . <&&&> Is it waterproof ? There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . <&&&> What is a tornado warning ? Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? <&&&> No . what's it like ? <&&&> It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing ! <&&&> Would you want to live there ? How are you , Sue ? <&&&> Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . <&&&> Congratulations on your success . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> And how ’ s your brother ? Was there an accident on the freeway today ? <&&&> You haven't heard about it ? <&&&> No , don't you know what happened ? <&&&> This truck flipped over on the 210 . <&&&> Are you serious ? <&&&> I'm telling you the truth . What seems to be the problem , kid ? <&&&> I've got a sore throat , a runny nose and a headache . <&&&> Ah ... How long have you been like this ? <&&&> I am not very sure . Maybe for three days . I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . <&&&> Very well . We have some fresh red roses . <&&&> How much are the roses ? Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer ? <&&&> We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special . <&&&> I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean . We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine . <&&&> There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting . <&&&> But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday ! <&&&> Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working . <&&&> Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ? <&&&> I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers ! <&&&> That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean . <&&&> We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like . Where are you planning on transferring to ? <&&&> I can ’ t seem to make a decision . <&&&> Where do you want to go ? <&&&> I honestly have no idea . <&&&> You haven ’ t thought about it ? <&&&> I like it here at PCC . <&&&> Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ? <&&&> I like that idea . <&&&> It ’ s a great school . How much altogether ? <&&&> $ 40 . ... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . <&&&> Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! <&&&> What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? <&&&> Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . I don't understand why I'm being arrested . <&&&> You have a warrant . <&&&> A warrant for what ? <&&&> Apparently , you have a bench warrant . <&&&> What does that mean ? <&&&> You missed a court appearance . <&&&> I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . <&&&> I don't know what to tell you . <&&&> I don't find this fair . All the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth . I don't stand a chance of passing the exam . Excuse me ... Northwest Airline . <&&&> Hello , I'd like to reconfirm my flight .

Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . <&&&> There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . <&&&> Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . <&&&> And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . <&&&> You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ?

Where ’ s that ? <&&&> It ’ s at the corner of that street . Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ? <&&&> I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . <&&&> I see . When did it start ? <&&&> It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . <&&&> Have you got a temperature ? <&&&> I think so . I feel very hot . <&&&> Let's see . Yes .

May I see the manager of your office ? <&&&> I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ? <&&&> Thank you . I am Fred , coming from Future Clothes Company . I've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . I think Andy's party will be fun . <&&&> Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . <&&&> What's that ? <&&&> Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? <&&&> Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? Yesterday was April the first . <&&&> Was it quite special ? <&&&> Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . <&&&> Did you hurry back to the bedroom ? <&&&> Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . I feel like I'm craving a salad . <&&&> What kind do you want ? <&&&> I have no idea . <&&&> Caesar salads are good . <&&&> I like those too . <&&&> What kind do you plan on making ? <&&&> I'd really like a salad with chicken . <&&&> Chicken salads are really good . Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? <&&&> Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . <&&&> Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? <&&&> No , I first came here 1995 . It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ? <&&&> Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ? <&&&> Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ? <&&&> I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ? <&&&> Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work . <&&&> OK , then let's try to go this weekend . I should know if I can go by Friday . Is it OK if I call you then ? <&&&> Yeah , that's fine . <&&&> What's your number ? <&&&> 233-331-8828 . Let me give you my email address too . It's Tom861@gmail.com <&&&> OK , I'll talk to you soon . Can I help you ? <&&&> My wife and I want to go to Beijing for a tour . Can you arrange it ? <&&&> Yes , we can arrange that . <&&&> I'd like to know what kind of tour your travel agency has . <&&&> Our travel agency provides all kinds of tours , ranging from individual tour to group package tour . <&&&> Excellent . <&&&> When do you expect to come ? <&&&> September 28th . Nice to meet you . What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? <&&&> I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . <&&&> Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . <&&&> Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! <&&&> You're right . I love going out and making new friends . Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? <&&&> Yes . I've read it carefully . <&&&> And do you have any questions ? <&&&> No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? <&&&> No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . <&&&> But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . <&&&> I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? <&&&> Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? <&&&> I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . <&&&> I can accept that . <&&&> Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . <&&&> Even my health insurance ? <&&&> Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . <&&&> I have a few questions about the free membership . <&&&> What would you like to know ? <&&&> Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? What are the seasons like in your city ? <&&&> Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . <&&&> Does it ever rain in summer ? <&&&> We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . <&&&> What are spring and autumn like ? <&&&> I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . What are the seasons like in you city ? <&&&> Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot .

What do you think of this flat ? <&&&> It's not really all that good . The bedroom is a little small for us . <&&&> Small , but it should be enough for our needs . I think . <&&&> But there's no hot water after 10 at night . Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . It feels good . <&&&> That's true . But I love the living room ; it's huge and filled with sunshine . <&&&> True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped . <&&&> It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . <&&&> You're right . The view is spectacular . But that bedroom is so small . We'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? <&&&> That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . <&&&> What was she like ? <&&&> She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . <&&&> What kind of things did you learn ? <&&&> She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . <&&&> Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? <&&&> If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . <&&&> You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? <&&&> She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . <&&&> I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . <&&&> Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . this is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . <&&&> are you serious ? <&&&> yes , I mean it . <&&&> but why ? Did I do anything wrong ? <&&&> no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . <&&&> hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that .

I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . <&&&> but I still love you . <&&&> I ’ m sorry . <&&&> I knew this would happen some day ... <&&&> then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? I'm so thirsty . <&&&> Let's go get something to drink . <&&&> That's a good idea . <&&&> Do you know what you want to drink ? <&&&> I kind of want a soda . <&&&> You shouldn't drink soda when you're really thirsty . <&&&> What do you mean ? What's the life expectancy in your country ? <&&&> I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? <&&&> About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . <&&&> I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . <&&&> Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . <&&&> Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment . <&&&> How's your son these days ? So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? <&&&> Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . <&&&> That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? <&&&> I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . <&&&> Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . <&&&> That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . <&&&> Oh , God , I've forgotten it . <&&&> You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . <&&&> Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . <&&&> They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . <&&&> Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? <&&&> It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . <&&&> So you just talk all the time ? <&&&> Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us . I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . <&&&> I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable . <&&&> Would you like to get in shape together ? <&&&> What do you have in mind ? <&&&> How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . <&&&> I know the one you mean . Do you know how much the memberships are ? <&&&> As a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now . have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? <&&&> yeah , almost . But there is one thing . <&&&> what ? <&&&> I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... <&&&> what is it ? <&&&> some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . <&&&> that makes you feel uncomfortable ? Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . <&&&> Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . <&&&> No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . <&&&> Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . I think I need some iced water , too . Is there an extra charge for that ? Good morning ! My name is John White , import manager of the Garden Trading Company of New York . <&&&> Oh , how do you to Mr . White ? My name is Li Ming , here is my card . <&&&> Nice to meet you Mr.Li .

I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? <&&&> yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . <&&&> they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? <&&&> I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . <&&&> so are you enjoying your new job ? <&&&> it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . <&&&> how do you like working in sales ? <&&&> I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . <&&&> that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . <&&&> yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! <&&&> I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! <&&&> how do you know her ? Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red . <&&&> Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution . Alright , tell me what you think . <&&&> Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? <&&&> Yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? <&&&> This dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? <&&&> No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . <&&&> I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . I really want to get something to eat . <&&&> What are you going to get ? <&&&> I don't know what I want to eat . <&&&> Well , do you want burgers , Chinese food , or Mexican food ? <&&&> Chinese food sounds good . <&&&> Where are you going to get it from ? <&&&> I haven't the slightest idea . May I try on this pair of shoes ? <&&&> Of course . What is your size ? <&&&> I think it's 35 . <&&&> OK .

Ah , Hello . So , you are back ? <&&&> Yes . I received everything in the post this morning .

Excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ? <&&&> This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . <&&&> That is nice .

I'd like to reconfirm my flight , please . <&&&> May I have your name and flight number , please ? <&&&> My name is Daniel Adams and my flight number is 374 . Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? <&&&> I don't think we can . <&&&> Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? <&&&> By the middle of October , I think . <&&&> That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . <&&&> I understand . <&&&> Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . <&&&> But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . <&&&> Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . <&&&> I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . <&&&> That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . <&&&> You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . <&&&> But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . Did you make it to school today ? <&&&> I always do . Did you go to school today ? <&&&> No , I didn't . <&&&> You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? <&&&> That was an odd change of subject . <&&&> Maybe it was , but answer the question . No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . <&&&> Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? <&&&> Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . <&&&> Alright Steve . Your social security number ? <&&&> 349-95- 8821 . Hello , Tom ! <&&&> Hello , Steven ! <&&&> How are you doing ? <&&&> Not bad . What about you ? <&&&> I'm just a little tired . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> I have a lot of work to do in the company recently . <&&&> How is your family ? Are we here yet ? <&&&> Not quite yet . <&&&> How far away is it ? <&&&> It's still very far away . <&&&> How many miles to go ? <&&&> We're getting close . Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? <&&&> Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . <&&&> What was that ? <&&&> Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . <&&&> Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . <&&&> Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . <&&&> I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! <&&&> He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! <&&&> Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . <&&&> That's serious . <&&&> I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . <&&&> So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . <&&&> Yes , it's an amazing drop .

Maybe going around for a while . <&&&> Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? <&&&> Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . <&&&> Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . <&&&> You hit the nail right on the head . <&&&> Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? <&&&> What is it ? Hi , are you Catherine ? Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? <&&&> We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . <&&&> Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population .

What else ? <&&&> We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . good morning ! My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . <&&&> Let's see .

I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . <&&&> yeah , that's nice . <&&&> hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . <&&&> a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? <&&&> I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .

What do you want , Madam ? <&&&> I want haircut and perm . <&&&> How long would you like your haircut today ? <&&&> Just cut a little off . <&&&> You wanna tight , medium or naturally curly perm ? <&&&> I'd like to have medium . <&&&> How about you hair style ? <&&&> Can you tell me my choices ? I think I'm going to go to the market today . <&&&> Do we need food ? <&&&> Yeah , I think so . <&&&> What are you going to get ? <&&&> I'm not sure what we need . <&&&> Maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator .

I really want to go to the beach this weekend . <&&&> That sounds like fun .

I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend . <&&&> I know . I really want to go to the beach . <&&&> But you know that California weather is really unpredictable . <&&&> You're right . One minute it's hot , and then the next minute it's cold . It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner . Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? <&&&> My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . <&&&> Did you finish typing yesterday ? <&&&> Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . <&&&> Don't worry about it .

Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? <&&&> Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! <&&&> Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . <&&&> He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! <&&&> She's chic , isn't she ? Do you still see the people we went to school with ? Don ’ t you think that ’ s good idea to hold a party outside ? <&&&> I don ’ t think so . <&&&> How about going to a concert ? Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? <&&&> Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . <&&&> Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . <&&&> What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? <&&&> We should choose from the backups . <&&&> That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . <&&&> That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . <&&&> That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . <&&&> Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? <&&&> I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . <&&&> Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . <&&&> Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? <&&&> Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . <&&&> Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? Mary , it seems that your family and friends have been calling you recently , am I right ? Excuse me . Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any . <&&&> I'm not sure if we've got any now . Books of that kind are on this shelf . Well , I'm afraid we've sold out . <&&&> What a pity ! I should have come earlier . We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . <&&&> I guess we should start with nominees first . <&&&> Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? <&&&> Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . Would you please weight this letter for me ?

You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . <&&&> What about all these other pieces ? Hi , Andy . I am going to Isabel ’ s . Are you coming ? <&&&> No . The things are too expensive there for me . I can't afford it . <&&&> That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ? <&&&> Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change . <&&&> All right , but hurry up . It takes you hours to change . <&&&> I will . Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap ? I mean this is the last day . Hello ? <&&&> Hi Steve . This is Mike .

Let's get together and do something . <&&&> I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? <&&&> Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . <&&&> Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ? <&&&> I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny . <&&&> That's great . We can do something outdoors then . <&&&> Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? <&&&> Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . <&&&> Oh yeah .

Are you sure it's funny , though ? <&&&> Well , you'll see . <&&&> OK . <&&&> OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . <&&&> I see . <&&&> So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . <&&&> Oh , that's funny ! <&&&> Hang on , I haven't finished yet . <&&&> Oh , sorry . <&&&> Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . <&&&> A car door ? You mean just one car door ? Good afternoon . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like to check in , please . <&&&> May I see your ticket and passport , please ? <&&&> Sure .

Are you absolutely certain it was her ? I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . <&&&> Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? <&&&> That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? does your family have a record of your ancestors ? <&&&> sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years .

You have been absent from class five times this semester . <&&&> I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . <&&&> I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . <&&&> Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . <&&&> Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . <&&&> Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . <&&&> But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? <&&&> What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . <&&&> Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . I need to eat something . They are professors and government officials . <&&&> Where are they from ? <&&&> Most of them are from America and Europe . Hello , reservation desk . Can I help you ?

What are your weekend arrangements ? <&&&> There're many things I can do on weekends . <&&&> What sort of things are you interested in ? <&&&> I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ? <&&&> I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour .

Well , everything is packed and ready to go . <&&&> It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . <&&&> Yes .

Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... <&&&> Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . <&&&> Oh , right !

That's easy . <&&&> And when do you prepare for your final exam ? This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . <&&&> Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir . 911 .

You got a letter in the mail . <&&&> Give it to me . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . <&&&> What does it say ? <&&&> I ’ Ve been accepted ! <&&&> Are you serious ? I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter . <&&&> Would she be interested in a laptop ? <&&&> That's exactly what I was thinking of . Can I still catch T107 for Xiamen ? <&&&> Sorry , sir . The train has already left . <&&&> That's too bad . Can I take another train ? <&&&> Yes . Your ticket is valid for three days . <&&&> That's great ! I will take the next train . <&&&> You have to have your ticket checked . Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? <&&&> Sounds good , when ? Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . <&&&> He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . <&&&> Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast . <&&&> Oh , good ! You know , I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs , not fried . Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ? <&&&> Yes , I have found three companies . <&&&> Have you called to inquire about the positions ? <&&&> Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . <&&&> What a pity ! <&&&> The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue . <&&&> It's frustrating ! <&&&> The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates . <&&&> Wonder why they do that ! Is there anything I can do for you ? <&&&> I would like to go to Europe for a visit ? Can you recommend me an interesting city ? <&&&> Why not go to Paris ? It's famous for Arch of Triumph , Eiffel , versailles and place de la Concorde . May I take your order ? have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? <&&&> no . what's it like ? <&&&> it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through <&&&> would you want to live there ? <&&&> I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro <&&&> what's your dreamhole like then ? <&&&> my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? Hey honey , how was your day ? Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 . <&&&> I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . May I help you ? <&&&> I need to copy some pages in my book . <&&&> The copier is right over there , in the corner . <&&&> Do I need to pay to use it ? What's wrong ? <&&&> I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . <&&&> You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . <&&&> The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . <&&&> They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . <&&&> But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? <&&&> The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . <&&&> Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . Excuse me , this is my first time on a plane . How do I check in ? <&&&> May I see your ticket , please ? <&&&> Yes . Here you are . <&&&> You can get a boarding pass at that counter . Do you have anything to check in ? <&&&> No , I only have a handbag . <&&&> Then you could wait in the departure area after going through security . <&&&> Is that all ? Have you been served , sir ? <&&&> I am just looking , thank you ... Excuse me . Can you tell me where I can buy a pair of shoes ? <&&&> It's on the fourth floor . How long do you plan to stay here ? What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? <&&&> He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I sent in my resume at the end of last week . I'm applying for the accounts assistant position . <&&&> May I have your name please ? <&&&> My name is Judy Liao . That's spelled L I A O . <&&&> Alright ... And did you have some specific questions about your application ? <&&&> Not really . I was in the neighborhood , and I just wanted to stop in to see if you received my resume . <&&&> Oh , that's no problem . Just give me a moment , and I can check.Judy Liao . Let's see ... Yes , here it is . Judy Liao . We have received your resume . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Is there anything else I can help you with ? Are you ready to order ? The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . <&&&> Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? ( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight I have a parking ticket to pay for . Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! <&&&> What is it ? What happened ? <&&&> I think someone is stalking me . <&&&> No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? <&&&> I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . <&&&> Did he leave when you left ? <&&&> Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> He followed me all the way home ! <&&&> That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . <&&&> Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? <&&&> Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . <&&&> Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! <&&&> Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . <&&&> I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . <&&&> Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . <&&&> Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane ? <&&&> No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . Hello , Sir . Can I help you with anything ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to use the ATM to make a payment . But I need to pay 3 parties at once . <&&&> No problem at all . With this service , you can pay up to 10 parties at one time . Are these parties on your current beneficiaries list ? That way they look longer . <&&&> Now what are you doing ? <&&&> Putting on mascara . <&&&> Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . Are you sure you heard right ? <&&&> Yes , he is running for class president . <&&&> I don't believe you . what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . <&&&> My father failed in business . <&&&> Oh , that's really tough . Hi , Mike , what gives ? <&&&> Hi , Bill , this is my new car . <&&&> Hey , great set of wheels . <&&&> You like it , huh ? <&&&> Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . <&&&> It is special , isn't it ? <&&&> Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? <&&&> Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how have you been ? It ’ s been such a long time ! <&&&> Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! <&&&> Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! Good morning . Venus Real Estate Agency . Are you going to vote ? <&&&> Yes , are you ? <&&&> Yeah , but what day are the elections ? Hello . Smith ’ s Resident . <&&&> Hello . This is the operator . Can I speak to Mr . Smith , please ? Who's that striking woman over there ? <&&&> Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . <&&&> Really ? Why not ? She looks great . Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? <&&&> I don't think we can . <&&&> Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? <&&&> By the middle of October , I think . <&&&> That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . <&&&> I understand . <&&&> Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . how is your house hunting going ? Do you like chocolates ? <&&&> It depends . <&&&> Do you like coffee ? <&&&> Um . It ’ s delicious . <&&&> And do you like English food ? I would like to open an account today . <&&&> What kind ? <&&&> I want to open a checking account . <&&&> You need to keep a minimum balance .

You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you.Do you understand ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> What's your name ? <&&&> My name is James . <&&&> What's your nationality ? <&&&> American . <&&&> What's your relationship with the victim ? <&&&> I don't know him . <&&&> Why did you attack the victim ? <&&&> Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away . <&&&> How many times did you stab the victim ? <&&&> I stabbed his belly three times . <&&&> Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ? <&&&> I knew , but I couldn't myself . May I speak to Marry ? <&&&> She's in a meeting until noon . Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? <&&&> Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . <&&&> Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . <&&&> Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . <&&&> Okay ... <&&&> I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . <&&&> What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? I'm so thirsty . <&&&> Let's go get something to drink . <&&&> That's a good idea . <&&&> Do you know what you want to drink ? <&&&> I kind of want a soda . <&&&> You shouldn't drink soda when you're really thirsty . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> When you're thirsty , you're not supposed to drink soda . <&&&> What are you supposed to drink ? <&&&> Water is what's best for you . Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? <&&&> Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? <&&&> I was thinking about heading to the mall .

I love the low neck design . What a terrible house ! <&&&> I'm sick of it , too . Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? <&&&> Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . <&&&> Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? <&&&> Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? <&&&> Coffee , please . <&&&> So , you also like Coffee ? <&&&> Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . <&&&> Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . <&&&> I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . <&&&> But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction <&&&> I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . <&&&> Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! <&&&> Maybe you are right to some extent . <&&&> You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Do you have a reservation ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> May I have your name , please ? <&&&> Yes , it's Mr . Brown . <&&&> Mr . Brown .

Please take a seat . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . <&&&> Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . <&&&> Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ? What will happen to the children if you break up ? <&&&> That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . I really admire you , Diana . I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . Hello , sir . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ m looking for a winter jacket . <&&&> What size are you looking for ? <&&&> A medium is fine for me . <&&&> How about this one ? <&&&> I don ’ t like the color . <&&&> What color do you like ? <&&&> Blue . Hi , Is that David ? <&&&> Hi , Jenny . It's David here . <&&&> Hey , what's new ? <&&&> Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me . <&&&> Sorry to hear that . What happened ? <&&&> Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . <&&&> Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . <&&&> What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . <&&&> Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . <&&&> But she lied to me . <&&&> Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? <&&&> Ok , then . <&&&> But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . <&&&> What face ?

OK , thank you all the same . <&&&> If you don't mind , you can use my camera and leave your address with me so I can send you the photos later . <&&&> That's so kind of you . Thank you very much ! Excuse me , can you tell me the way to the Forbidden City , please ? <&&&> Sure . Go straight on down this road , take the second left and then the first right . It ’ s next to Tiananmen Square . <&&&> Thanks . Would you like to see our new shirts ? Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? <&&&> You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . <&&&> Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? <&&&> No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . <&&&> Did you register yet ? <&&&> Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . <&&&> What classes do you think are still open ? <&&&> Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . <&&&> That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . <&&&> I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . <&&&> He does that ? <&&&> I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . So what did you get ? Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you ? <&&&> I want to book a tour with adventure sports . <&&&> Excellent !

What else do you have ? <&&&> Well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . It ’ s the closest you can get to flying . <&&&> What ?

We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge . Can you send someone to fix my internet ? <&&&> Are you having a problem with it ? <&&&> My internet is having problems connecting . <&&&> Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up ? <&&&> I've been having this problem for the last few days . how can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend . <&&&> do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? <&&&> she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 .

Which sports are popular in your country ? <&&&> Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . <&&&> Do many people like tennis ? <&&&> More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . Hello , I've got to get up early tomorrow , so please give me a wake-up call . Does this hotel have a pool ? Do you have a bf ? <&&&> Yes , I had a bf before . <&&&> Why you say bf before ? <&&&> We parted from each other last month . <&&&> Have you got a new one ? <&&&> Mmmm , no . How about you ? <&&&> I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . <&&&> Haha , so you are my E-bf . <&&&> I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? <&&&> Mmmm . ..

They look ancient . <&&&> my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . <&&&> oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here . <&&&> your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming . How do you think people get their personalities ? <&&&> I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . Tell me something about yourself and your past . <&&&> I was born and grew up in hebes Province . I moved to Beijing , where I started taking courses for my MBA . When I completed my degree , I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company . I've worked there for eight years . <&&&> What was the most significant project you've worked on ? <&&&> I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . <&&&> What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ? <&&&> For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area . <&&&> How would your coworkers evaluate you ? <&&&> They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player . <&&&> What are your salary expectations ? What kind of music do you like listening to ? <&&&> I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . <&&&> I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . <&&&> Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . <&&&> Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . <&&&> Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . <&&&> I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . <&&&> You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . <&&&> That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ? <&&&> I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please . <&&&> It's possible to sign an agreement with us , and then we can pay your staff directly . That is called an Entrustment Agreement . <&&&> I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ? I'll have to go now . <&&&> Drop in if you're free.Bye for now ! Do you mind helping me ? <&&&> What can I help you with ? <&&&> I'm not sure how to find my next class . <&&&> Do you know what building that it's in ? <&&&> The C building , I think . <&&&> Well , that's not far away . <&&&> Could you point me in that direction ? <&&&> Do you know what the room number is ? <&&&> It's C261 . Look how fast that car can accelerate ! Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the library ? <&&&> Of course . It's on Memorial Avenue . <&&&> On Memorial Avenue ? Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . <&&&> You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . <&&&> You moved to a new place ? <&&&> Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . <&&&> Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? <&&&> It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find .

But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? <&&&> I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning <&&&> Does that mean studying all the time ? <&&&> I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . <&&&> Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . <&&&> You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts <&&&> Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . <&&&> Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . <&&&> You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French .

You look great ! You are beautiful ! <&&&> Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? <&&&> I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are 25 , stop being ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . It doesn ’ t look natural . Do you know how the national flag of Canada looks like ? Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? <&&&> Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . <&&&> I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . <&&&> I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? <&&&> I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . <&&&> Do we have Christmas pudding ? If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . <&&&> Would you ? I wouldn't . <&&&> What would you do ? <&&&> Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . <&&&> One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . <&&&> Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? <&&&> As I said , I'd go round the world . <&&&> What would you do after that ? <&&&> Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . <&&&> It doesn't sound very exciting . <&&&> Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? <&&&> I'd be happy if I got a rise . <&&&> And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . <&&&> Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . <&&&> What'll you have ? <&&&> I'll have a pint of the best . ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ? Excuse me . Can I get a refund of my ticket ? I have to cancel my trip because I have something emergent to deal with . <&&&> Which train is the ticket for ? <&&&> It is Train No . 249 .

I got the news yesterday . <&&&> You did a good job for the company . You deserve it . <&&&> You're flattering me . Do you have a free moment ? <&&&> Sure , what do you need ? <&&&> I am having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? <&&&> Well . First you have to turn this switch on . Hello , Sara are you finished packing yet ? Do you need a hand ? have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ? <&&&> no , I haven ’ t . I can ’ t think of anything to get him . <&&&> I ’ m having the same problem . I want to get something really special . Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts . <&&&> I know . He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly ! <&&&> he bought me an iron . <&&&> that doesn ’ t sound like a great present . hi , Natasha , how's life ? <&&&> great . My family came to visit me . Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? <&&&> My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . What about you ? <&&&> Well , I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? <&&&> For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share . <&&&> Don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ? <&&&> No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . What do you think of the one-child policy in China ? <&&&> If China didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? <&&&> That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy ! <&&&> Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance . <&&&> Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner . <&&&> But I exercise at the club . And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes . <&&&> That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . <&&&> What's the difference ? <&&&> There isn't much difference . But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner <&&&> And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? <&&&> They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce Mr . Simpson , if you are free , how about a lunch ? Holly , I just heard some terrible news . <&&&> Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . <&&&> What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . <&&&> That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . <&&&> Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? What case do you have against the police ? <&&&> I want to take them to court for arresting me . <&&&> I don ’ t understand . <&&&> There was no reason for them to arrest me . <&&&> They let you go , didn ’ t they ? <&&&> They released me the next morning . What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? <&&&> My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . <&&&> Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! <&&&> Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . May I see your passport please ? <&&&> Here is my passport . And this is the declaration form . <&&&> What is the purpose of your visit to the United States ? I would like to make a reservation for tomorrow . <&&&> I'm sorry but we are fully booked . Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? <&&&> I'm afraid I can't . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . <&&&> Could it be the battery ? <&&&> No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems . <&&&> Well , I suppose it could be the gas . <&&&> No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . <&&&> Perhaps it's the starter then ? What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . <&&&> What ? You've got to be kidding me ! What do you want , Essie ? hi , Betty.what ' s up ? <&&&> nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? <&&&> everything has been fine for the past several months . <&&&> great ! <&&&> well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners <&&&> sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? <&&&> as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . <&&&> absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . <&&&> for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . <&&&> yes . this must be a huge difference . Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus ! <&&&> Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . <&&&> Yes , that's exactly the bug I got .

You must hurry . <&&&> Show me the fastest way to get there . <&&&> Instead of walking , you can take this shuttle to get you there faster . Mary , do you often do your shopping online ? <&&&> Yes . I'm used to online shopping . It ’ s convenient and time-saving . You can buy anything you want and they will send it to your home or any place you want . May I help you ? <&&&> I would like to check out these books . <&&&> May I see your library card , please ? <&&&> Yes . Here you go . <&&&> Apparently , you have unpaid late fees . <&&&> I do ? <&&&> You owe some money . <&&&> Exactly how much do I owe ? <&&&> You owe $ 24.50 . <&&&> I won ’ t be able to pay that right now . Do you hear what happened to Sally ? <&&&> No , what ? <&&&> She had to go to the hospital . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . <&&&> Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! <&&&> Yeah , but that's what she did . <&&&> I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . <&&&> Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . Hello , there . How can I help ? <&&&> Hello . I'm hoping to buy some Treasury Certificates today . Are they available ? <&&&> Certainly , Visible Treasury Certificates . Then you can get a receipt from the savings office as proof of payment . Hence the ' visible ' , you can see it . <&&&> Ah , right . How much do I need to spend ? Do I need a visa ? <&&&> No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . <&&&> Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . <&&&> Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . <&&&> Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . <&&&> You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . Name and examination number , please . <&&&> My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too . <&&&> Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ? <&&&> No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon . <&&&> How much longer will Mr . Schmidt be up in the mountains ? What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . Can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like a pair of sports shoes . <&&&> Well , we have all kinds of sports shoes.Could you tell me what kind of sport you usually do ? <&&&> I just like jogging . <&&&> OK , then you can buy a pair of jogging shoes.Here are jogging shoes.Which pair do you like best ? <&&&> Er ... , that blue pair . I need size 43 , please . <&&&> Here you are.You can try them on . I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . <&&&> That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? <&&&> I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? <&&&> I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . <&&&> Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . <&&&> I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . <&&&> So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . <&&&> Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . Cigarette ? <&&&> Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? <&&&> Sorry , here . What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably . <&&&> It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . <&&&> Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . <&&&> Why ? This is a fair market price . <&&&> It certainly is . <&&&> Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . <&&&> I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . <&&&> We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . <&&&> That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . How do you like your work ? <&&&> The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . <&&&> What do you do ? <&&&> I work in a publishing house . How about you ? <&&&> Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . Here's our sample room . <&&&> You've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here . <&&&> Yes . We are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . And the demand is getting greater and greater.By the way , which items are you interested in ? <&&&> I'm particularly interested in shortbreads . Do you have some samples you could show me ? <&&&> Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require . <&&&> The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us . I wonder if Your pastry tastes better . Hey , Mary , what's up ? <&&&> Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . <&&&> Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? <&&&> Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . <&&&> It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? Do you have anything to declare ? <&&&> No . I have nothing . Hello , Sir .

Do you offer a course in business management ? <&&&> Yes , we do . <&&&> How many nights a week is it ? <&&&> It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . <&&&> And how long does the course last ? <&&&> It lasts for 9 months . <&&&> When does it start ? <&&&> The next beginning class starts on October 25th . <&&&> What time is the class ? <&&&> From 7 to 9 o'clock . <&&&> How much does it cost ? <&&&> It costs 125 dollars a month . <&&&> Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . <&&&> Thank you , please fill out this form for us . <&&&> Do you want me to fill it out now ? My name is Mary , and I will be your server this evening . <&&&> Hi Mary .

What ’ s your favorite number ? <&&&> How about 560 436 4040 . <&&&> I ’ m sorry . This number has already been registered . How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? <&&&> One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . <&&&> But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . Excuse me . How much for a two liter bottle of Coke ? <&&&> 87 cents . <&&&> How come so cheap ? Let's decide what to order . <&&&> I'll have a hamburger . <&&&> The works ? <&&&> No , just tomatoes , please . And large fries . Which language do you speak ? Have you considered upgrading your system ? <&&&> Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . <&&&> You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . <&&&> That would be a definite bonus . <&&&> You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . Can you help me find a nice gift for my young niece ? <&&&> Barbie dolls are quite popular , you know . <&&&> You're right . Girls love Barbie . Show me a Barbie doll . <&&&> Take a look at the newest Barbie — Digital Barbie . <&&&> She's beautiful .

You are the younger customer here ever . <&&&> It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . <&&&> It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? <&&&> Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? <&&&> That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . <&&&> I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . <&&&> Sure .

He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . <&&&> what happened to him then ? <&&&> not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . <&&&> did they take his license away ? <&&&> no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago .

So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? <&&&> It was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . <&&&> How could it be ? <&&&> While seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . Excuse me , madam . May I see your ticket , please ? <&&&> I'm afraid I have lost my ticket . Can I buy one again ? <&&&> Where are you going ? <&&&> I'm going to Nanchang . <&&&> Where did you begin your journey ? <&&&> At Huangshan . <&&&> OK . Here you are . May I fix an appointment with Dr.Cui ? <&&&> Sure . Has everything been OK with you lately ? <&&&> I haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . I ’ m exhausted ! I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . <&&&> That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . <&&&> But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . Mom , Happy mother's Day ! Here's my card . <&&&> What a surprise ! Thanks.It ' s beautiful . How do you like waltz ? <&&&> It's very nice , I like it very much . <&&&> May I invite you for the first dance ? <&&&> My pleasure .

But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . <&&&> I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . <&&&> Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? <&&&> Yes . And what dances do you like best ? <&&&> Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances . <&&&> Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . <&&&> My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . Is there anything wrong ? <&&&> I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . <&&&> Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . <&&&> I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . <&&&> You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . <&&&> But I just want to give her some tips . <&&&> Oh , she can make her own decisions . <&&&> I guess you are right . Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? <&&&> Let me check . It has a paper jam . Mum , this is for you . <&&&> Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? <&&&> Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! Thanks for the loan . Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview . <&&&> It's OK . <&&&> What did you do in the interview ? <&&&> I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . <&&&> Are all these helpful for the interview ? Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . <&&&> Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? <&&&> I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . <&&&> You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... So Beth , what kind of music do you listen to ? <&&&> I listen to a lot of hip hop . What about you ? What can I do for you ? I am starving . <&&&> Let's go get something to eat . <&&&> Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ? <&&&> We can always go to the cafeteria and eat . <&&&> I haven't eaten there before . well , I finished my last final today . <&&&> the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! <&&&> do you want to attend the convocation ? <&&&> certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? <&&&> Cinct de mayo ? <&&&> No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . <&&&> Do we get a day off from school then ? <&&&> No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . <&&&> Www , man ! <&&&> In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . <&&&> Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? Can I help you ? Were you at the scene during the robbery ? It seldom rains this summer . <&&&> Yeah , some places are very short of water . <&&&> Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . <&&&> You see , . This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone . Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet ? <&&&> The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . There are something wrong with my computer . <&&&> Really , what's wrong with it ? Hi , how can I help ? <&&&> I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . <&&&> Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . <&&&> Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? Excuse me . Can I deposit valuables here ? <&&&> Yes , you can . Please put your articles in this envelope and seal it . <&&&> OK . <&&&> How long would you like us to keep it ? <&&&> Till next Monday when we check out . Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage . <&&&> Yes , Mary ? Do you drink much ? <&&&> Depending on what you consider a lot . <&&&> How frequently do you drink ? <&&&> Couple times a week . How about you ? <&&&> Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . <&&&> How much can you drink ? <&&&> I usually only have 2 beers . <&&&> You're a light weight . <&&&> How much can you drink ? <&&&> I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . <&&&> Don't you spend a lot of money then ? <&&&> No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks . <&&&> That's true . <&&&> If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . <&&&> I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . Operator . <&&&> Hello .

Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . <&&&> I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family .

I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . <&&&> Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . <&&&> Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . <&&&> He seems to win awards everywhere . <&&&> He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . <&&&> I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it .

Would you like to leave a message ? <&&&> I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? <&&&> Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning .

Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? <&&&> 15 dollars per dozen <&&&> Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . <&&&> However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . <&&&> If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . <&&&> This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . <&&&> I hope you'll give a second thought to it . Would you like to come by and play bridge ? <&&&> Well , let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . <&&&> Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight .

The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance . <&&&> What kind of performance ? A lion dance ? <&&&> Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous . That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers . Hello , is this Professor Clark ? <&&&> Yes , I am Professor Clark . <&&&> Hello , Professor , this is Kalina , and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings . <&&&> Yes , how are you doing ? Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? <&&&> Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . <&&&> Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . <&&&> That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . <&&&> But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . <&&&> Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . <&&&> No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy . <&&&> We can figure that out right now . How much do you earn annually ? <&&&> My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year . <&&&> How many years have you held your current position ? <&&&> I have been at my current job for 10 years . <&&&> Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary ? <&&&> I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property .

I know Li Lin is there . Let me talk to her . <&&&> Sorry . There's no one named Li Lin here . Are you sure you have the right name ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> What number are you trying to dial ? <&&&> It's 423-6681 . Isn't it right ? <&&&> No . It isn't . It's 423-6631 . What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? <&&&> Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . <&&&> Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? <&&&> Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . <&&&> Excuse me ? <&&&> Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . <&&&> What kind of change , just in prices ? <&&&> No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . I had a great time on the last date . Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ? <&&&> I'd like that very much . <&&&> How does 7:30 sound ? What can I help you with today ? <&&&> My washing machine isn't working .

Also , how can I get my mailbox key ? <&&&> I ’ ll tell Peter to bring your key to your apartment right away . <&&&> Who ’ s Peter ? Do you have girlfriend ? <&&&> Yes , why ? <&&&> Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . <&&&> So ? <&&&> So I think I may fall in love with her . <&&&> That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? <&&&> Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? <&&&> That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . <&&&> That's what I do . <&&&> And you think about her all the time ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . <&&&> That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . <&&&> Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate . <&&&> Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another . <&&&> Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . Good morning sir , I come to fetch me suit . <&&&> Sure .

I don't make idle threats . <&&&> I guess not . <&&&> I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . <&&&> Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . <&&&> If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail .

Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you ? <&&&> I want to book a tour with adventure sports . <&&&> Excellent ! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options . This is our most popular choice , our river guides will take you on a whitewater rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon ! <&&&> I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ? <&&&> Well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . It ’ s the closest you can get to flying . <&&&> What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next ! <&&&> Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge . <&&&> I ’ m thinking something exciting but . safer . <&&&> I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey ! I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? <&&&> Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? <&&&> Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . <&&&> I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it . <&&&> It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions . <&&&> What instructions ? <&&&> We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . <&&&> I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know . <&&&> Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! <&&&> Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? <&&&> Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . <&&&> Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? <&&&> The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . <&&&> Alright . <&&&> Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust . <&&&> Sawdust ? <&&&> Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . <&&&> That makes sense . <&&&> Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting . <&&&> And I can choose any color ? <&&&> Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir . <&&&> And after the varnish ? <&&&> After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . <&&&> And then ? <&&&> Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . <&&&> It all sounds very complicated . <&&&> It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . Good morning . <&&&> Er , good morning , yes , er ... <&&&> I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . Hello , Vicki . <&&&> Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . <&&&> Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . <&&&> I think seven hundred is enough . <&&&> What ? Seven hundred ? Would you be kind enough to lend me forty pounds ? What ’ s up ? <&&&> I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? <&&&> Yes , . Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? <&&&> Of course not , I appreciate that . <&&&> Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . <&&&> I see . What can I do now ? Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . <&&&> Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . <&&&> Ok , so can I say , " This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . <&&&> That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . <&&&> Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " . <&&&> A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , " Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks " . Is there anything I can help you with ? <&&&> Yes , thank you . I am really far behind on this project . Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ? <&&&> I can do either one . <&&&> Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ? <&&&> No problem . <&&&> Thank you very much !

Doctor , may I ask my mother ’ s condition ? <&&&> Well , you'd better sit down for this . It has been terminal lung cancer . <&&&> Oh my god . Please save her life .

Could you take one more from this angle ? <&&&> no problem . <&&&> now let's have one together . <&&&> do you know how to set the timer ? Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? <&&&> I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . <&&&> I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? <&&&> I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . <&&&> I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? <&&&> Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . <&&&> All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? Is that Room service ? I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process . <&&&> As your realtor , I am here to take care of this process . How much were you planning on offering ? Wow , Amy , look at that number . <&&&> What's so great about it ? <&&&> What do you mean ? It's a scrim . Do you know something about Mount Tai ? <&&&> Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China . <&&&> Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ? <&&&> Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . <&&&> Got it . Can we see any things left by them ? <&&&> Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . Excuse me . <&&&> Yeah ? <&&&> I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ? <&&&> You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy . <&&&> Yes , but ... well ... <&&&> What ? <&&&> How do I use the machines ? <&&&> What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers . <&&&> I see . Do the machines have soap in them ? <&&&> No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ? <&&&> No . I don't have soap . <&&&> Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . <&&&> Thanks.Okay . I have my soap . <&&&> My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? <&&&> I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean . <&&&> But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out . <&&&> Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before . <&&&> What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ? <&&&> No . Never . <&&&> I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ? <&&&> I'm nineteen . <&&&> But how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ? <&&&> My mother always did it . <&&&> Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself . <&&&> I know about this fact.American children are more independent . They do more for themselves.But I am from Taiwan . In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before . You shouldn't laugh at me for it . Were you around when the robbery happened ? <&&&> Yes , I was . <&&&> Could you explain what you saw ? <&&&> I was in the bank at the time of the robbery . <&&&> What did you see ? <&&&> I saw a man come in with a gun . <&&&> Did you see his face ? <&&&> No . He had a mask on . <&&&> Did he come in with anyone else ? <&&&> He was by himself . I think I going to need some iced water too . Is there an extra charge for that ? <&&&> Yes , we charge 50 cents for water . Have you been having any problems lately ? <&&&> No , but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked . <&&&> Do you have a history of high blood pressure ? <&&&> No , I have never been told that I have high blood pressure . <&&&> High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms . <&&&> How do you check for high blood pressure ? I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it . <&&&> Is it horror movie ? <&&&> Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ? Hello , room service . Can I help you ? I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . <&&&> It's nothing to get upset about . <&&&> I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy . <&&&> Nice to meet you , I'am Simon . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ? <&&&> Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week . <&&&> Oh , I'm fine , thanks . I'm super busy with work actually . Did you hear about the Lawson contract ? <&&&> No , tell me more . Did you take the written test ? <&&&> I haven't taken it yet . <&&&> Make sure to study first . <&&&> I study every night . <&&&> I'm sure you're ready . <&&&> Does it cost money ? <&&&> No , it doesn't cost anything . <&&&> Does the test cover everything in the manual ? <&&&> It skips around . <&&&> Did you pass the test your first try ? <&&&> I thought it would be easy , but I didn't pass it . Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! Hello . Is this Ann ? <&&&> Yes , it is . Kelly ? <&&&> Yes , it's me . <&&&> Do you have a cold ? <&&&> No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . <&&&> Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? <&&&> I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . <&&&> I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? Hey , Jim . Wake up ! <&&&> Do I have to get up now ? <&&&> You'd better get up or you'll be late . <&&&> What are you talking about ? The alarm hasn't even gone off yet . <&&&> Yes , It has . It went off 30 minutes ago . Sam , you ’ Ve got to forgive me . <&&&> Forgive you for what ? <&&&> I used your computer . And I ’ m afraid I ’ Ve erased your personal files accidentally . <&&&> No ! Are you kidding me ? <&&&> I ’ m afraid not . I apologize . <&&&> I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . <&&&> I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? Can I help you , ma'am . <&&&> Yes , will you keep our bags until 6 p . m . ? <&&&> Are you all our guests ? <&&&> Yes , we checked out just now . <&&&> Please fill in this form . <&&&> Is this all right ? your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta <&&&> would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . <&&&> this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . <&&&> cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? <&&&> ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? <&&&> sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . Come in and sit down , Jack.Now , what's the trouble ? When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . <&&&> Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . <&&&> I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! <&&&> I thought you were good at the high jump ! <&&&> No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . <&&&> Did you ever win any competitions ? <&&&> I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? <&&&> I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? May I help you ? Miss ! <&&&> Yes . I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow . <&&&> What color set do you prefer ? <&&&> Well , brown . <&&&> We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . Look at the colors . Aren't they beautiful ? <&&&> But they're purple . I prefer a brown set . <&&&> If you insist , I can show you the brown sets . I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though . <&&&> Well , I'm not so sure . Most of my make-up is brown . <&&&> Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it . <&&&> Can I try it ? Is there a vacant table for two now ? What can I do for you , sir ? Johnny , I can't believe you would do that . <&&&> I know , Grandma , I just ... <&&&> You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! How nice it is here . I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . <&&&> Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . What in the world is that smell ? <&&&> The aroma of roasting coffee beans . <&&&> Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? <&&&> Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . <&&&> Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? Joy Chain elementary school , please . <&&&> Will do . <&&&> How frustrating ! The bus is still not coming . <&&&> Ma'am , take your kid to school ? <&&&> Yes . I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . <&&&> No problem . Don't worry , the taxi is faster than the bus . <&&&> The traffic is terrible on Monday morning . It takes us almost 1 hour to get to school . Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ? <&&&> I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ? As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . <&&&> It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . Do you know his sister ? <&&&> Her name is Laura , isn't it ? <&&&> That's right . <&&&> How old is she ? <&&&> Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . <&&&> What does she look like ? do you have any plans for Friday night ? <&&&> I don't think so . Why ? <&&&> well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ? <&&&> sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ? <&&&> the more , the merrier ! <&&&> will there be a lot of people there ? <&&&> I sure hope so . We've each invited about 10 people . <&&&> who else is going to be there ? <&&&> I'm inviting my friends from work , you , my sister , and a few friends from school . <&&&> I know your sister . She's very nice . <&&&> don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself . <&&&> what time is it going to start ? <&&&> most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm . <&&&> should I bring anything ? <&&&> we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . <&&&> I could also bring some music if you want . I've got loads of songs on my new iPod . Come on in . Let me show you around . Here ’ s the living room . <&&&> Great . The view from this window is wonderful . <&&&> This is the kitchen . <&&&> It looks new . <&&&> Yes . We just renovated a few month ago . <&&&> I like it . Hey , Tom . I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> It's for a job . It looks perfect for you . <&&&> Let me see . Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Susan Lee . Oh , I don't know ... Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? <&&&> My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . <&&&> Did you finish typing it yesterday ? <&&&> Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . <&&&> Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? <&&&> Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . <&&&> How about the shelf ? <&&&> I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? <&&&> Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . <&&&> I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? <&&&> Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? <&&&> Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? Hello ? <&&&> Hi Vicky . Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too . <&&&> Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ? Can you change American dollars into French francs . <&&&> Yes . How much do you want ? <&&&> Fifty dollars . What is the exchange rate today ? <&&&> One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ? <&&&> Yes , please . and you can cash my travelers check . Can ’ t you ? How are you going all these days ? Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , John . <&&&> I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska . <&&&> Are you kidding me ? <&&&> You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? Excuse me , can I have your passport , your immigration form and your Customs Declaration Form , please ? <&&&> OK . Here you are . <&&&> How long will you be staying at Hotel in China ? I heard you've found a new job . <&&&> Yes , I'm now working in a company . <&&&> So you're quite happy with your new job ? Do you think it's time to sign the contract , Mr . Simpson ? <&&&> I'd like to look it over before I sign it . Please do excuse me for a moment . I've got diarrhea . <&&&> It's easy to get loose bowels in summer . <&&&> It may have something to do with the food I had last night <&&&> You ’ Ve got to be careful on the food you eat . What date is today ? <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? <&&&> I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? <&&&> Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . Open the book and turn to page 10 . <&&&> It is difficult . Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image . <&&&> Surely it is . <&&&> You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him . <&&&> You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words . <&&&> When you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer . <&&&> Don't move from time to time . It is very impolite and will make you nervous . <&&&> Proper posture can show your confidence . <&&&> The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer . <&&&> Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well . Julia , are you free tonight ? <&&&> What's up ? <&&&> I want to invite you to go to the movies . <&&&> Are you asking me for a date ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I don ’ t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there . <&&&> Where do you want to meet ? Sorry to have smoked in your room . <&&&> Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll open the window . <&&&> It ’ s very kind of you . <&&&> Smoking is harmful for your health . Excuse me . Do you know how to get to the mall ? <&&&> Sure , I used to work there . Go straight for about a mile , then turn left at the light . The mall will be on the right . <&&&> Do you know the address ? <&&&> Yes , the address is 541 Main street . <&&&> Can you write it down for me please ? <&&&> No problem . <&&&> Is it faster if I take Highland avenue ? Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? <&&&> Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? <&&&> Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! <&&&> Did you bow back ? <&&&> No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . <&&&> Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . <&&&> But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? <&&&> Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . <&&&> Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? <&&&> I think it's highly possible , yes . <&&&> The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . <&&&> that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . <&&&> great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . <&&&> do you prefer brandy or ports . <&&&> port , please . <&&&> excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . <&&&> the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? <&&&> yes . You always have a good nose for wines . <&&&> next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . <&&&> oh , what's that ? <&&&> it's made from naturally frozen grapes . <&&&> why not ? It sounds great . I don't think the lecture is very interesting . <&&&> The lecturer is dull , too . Adam . I ’ m sorry . <&&&> Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . <&&&> Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . <&&&> why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? Excuse me ? <&&&> Yes . Can I help you ? <&&&> Well , I bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . But I got the wrong size . It ’ s too small for my daughter . I wonder if I could refund it . <&&&> Yes , you could if it's kept intact . But don't you want to get a bigger size ? Do you like traveling ? <&&&> Yes , I've just come back from Scotland . <&&&> Where did you visit ? <&&&> I only had time to visit Edinburgh . What will you do now ? Propose to her . <&&&> Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! <&&&> What is it ? What happened ? <&&&> I think someone is stalking me . <&&&> No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? <&&&> I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . <&&&> Did he leave when you left ? <&&&> Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> He followed me all the way home ! the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? <&&&> I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . <&&&> where are you planning on going ? <&&&> I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? I have to find a living room set . <&&&> Where are you planning on looking for one ? <&&&> I don't know . <&&&> I can tell you where I got mine . <&&&> Where did you go to find yours ? How are you doing today ? Kids are always difficult to control . <&&&> True . When I tell my kids to behaves themselves , they will make a face and slip away . Can I ask you what the office rules are ? Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . <&&&> There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . <&&&> I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . <&&&> Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . <&&&> When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? <&&&> Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . <&&&> When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . <&&&> That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . <&&&> That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . Good afternoon . What can I do for you ? It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I'd like to get this prescription filled . <&&&> No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed . <&&&> Thanks . Do you sell aspirin here ? <&&&> Yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf . Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . <&&&> Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . <&&&> The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? Hello sir , how can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need this prescription please . <&&&> Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ? Anything I can do for you ? <&&&> Yes , I just forgot where the bed linens department is . can I see these silk ties ? <&&&> No problem . <&&&> I ’ ll take this one . <&&&> Good . Anything else ? The tie pins ? The cuff links ? do you believe in UFO's ? <&&&> sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score . Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ? What type of movies do you like ? <&&&> I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction . <&&&> That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ? This is exciting ! Thank you so much ! <&&&> My pleasure . Release the parking brake , and we're almost ready to go . <&&&> Boy oh , boy ! This is so cool . Let's rock and roll ! <&&&> OK . Relax . This car is an automatic , so you don't have to worry about a clutch . I heard you are going to move . <&&&> Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . <&&&> What are you worried about ? <&&&> I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . Peter , why don't you go outside and play basketball with your friends ? <&&&> No , Mum , I'd rather stay inside . Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ? <&&&> Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work . Room Service . May I help you ? <&&&> This is Room 603 . I'm afraid that the heating system doesn't work . It's very cold here . <&&&> Have you switched on the radiator ? <&&&> Yes . I have switched it on for a long time . The room is still very cold . I've got a telegraphic order . Will you cash it ? <&&&> Have you got any identification ( ID ) with you ? <&&&> Yes . Here is my passport . <&&&> What currency will you have ? <&&&> US dollars , please . <&&&> All right , and how will you have it ? Hello , miss . Can you bring me something to drink ? <&&&> Sure , sir . But there is a charge for alcoholic beverages in economy class . Would you please refer to this price list ? And then give me your order . <&&&> Thank you for reminding me . Well , please give me a glass of brandy and I will pay for it . Hey Mike . What are you doing ? <&&&> Nothing much . What are you up to ? <&&&> I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some popcorn and Coke . <&&&> Go ahead . Waste your money . <&&&> What are you talking about ? We always eat the stuff here . <&&&> Well , I don't ... anymore . <&&&> But what's a movie without munchies ? Do you have a moment ? <&&&> Sure . What do you need ? <&&&> I'm having some trouble . I don't know how to use this printer . I've never seen this kind of office printer before . Is it a new brand ? <&&&> Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on . <&&&> Silly me ! <&&&> Now press this button . <&&&> Oh , it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down . <&&&> Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . <&&&> Your English is fluent . <&&&> Thank you . Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ? <&&&> No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream . <&&&> What's that ? <&&&> It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit . <&&&> Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ? Would you like me to type it for you ? <&&&> Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? <&&&> Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . <&&&> Thank you very much . <&&&> Shall I write out again first ? <&&&> No , there ’ s no need . <&&&> Can I print it ? I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ? <&&&> So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . <&&&> What part of the film do you like best ? <&&&> Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . <&&&> I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears . What would you like to drink ? Hi . What can I get for you ? <&&&> I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please . <&&&> Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . <&&&> I should say it is something we have never come across before . <&&&> The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? Hi , is that Li Ling ? <&&&> Yes . What can I do for you ? Dad , why are you taping the windows ? <&&&> Honey , a typhoon is coming . <&&&> Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow . <&&&> Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food . Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking . May I take your order ? <&&&> Um yes , I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . <&&&> We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ? Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . <&&&> Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . <&&&> Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? <&&&> We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! <&&&> Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! <&&&> Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! Want to send out for some Chinese ? <&&&> Some what ? <&&&> Some Chinese food . I ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . <&&&> No , I ’ d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? <&&&> Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like . Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? <&&&> Nothing planned . How about you ? <&&&> Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . <&&&> I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . <&&&> I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff . <&&&> But we have to work tomorrow . <&&&> We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work . Hello . May I help you ? <&&&> Hi . Last month , our company , Turner Interiors of Beijing , ordered some documents under our new L / C . What I want to do is check and see if the documents have arrived yet . <&&&> Let me find that on my screen ... yes , the L / C is right here . I'm sorry ; the documents don't seem to be here yet . <&&&> Oh , dear . When do you think they will arrive ? Where do we get off at ? <&&&> I think we have a little ways to go . <&&&> This bus ride is taking forever . <&&&> I know . Hey , Mark , long time no see . <&&&> Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? <&&&> Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . <&&&> Really ? How was it ? Dad , do you know where Mom is ? <&&&> I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . <&&&> She'd better not start crying like she usually does . <&&&> I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? I heard that Janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I heard that they pay very well . <&&&> I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . <&&&> Now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . <&&&> Yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . <&&&> You ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ? <&&&> Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . <&&&> They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . <&&&> Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? <&&&> He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . I'm looking for some blush . Do you still have some in peach rose ? <&&&> Oh , yes , that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left . <&&&> Great , I'll take one . <&&&> Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any Elizabeth Arden products , you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick , mascara and two shades of white shadow . <&&&> Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ? Good evening , Mr . Wu . <&&&> Good evening , Mr . Smith . <&&&> Have you met my wife , Mary ? Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ? <&&&> Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters . <&&&> Is uncle Bill your brother ? I ’ m forming a music band . <&&&> Do you already know how to play an instrument ? <&&&> Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . <&&&> Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? <&&&> Good morning . I ’ m looking for a new jacket . <&&&> Our jackets are over here next to coats and accessories . <&&&> I like this jacket . Can I try it on ? Waiter , a table for two , please . <&&&> Yes , this way please . <&&&> Can we see the menu please . <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> What ’ s good today ? <&&&> I recommend crisp beef and fried duck . <&&&> We don ’ t want that . Well . perhaps will be begin with mushroom soap and follow by some seafood and chips . <&&&> Do you want any dissert ? That looks like an interesting book . <&&&> It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . <&&&> There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . <&&&> They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . <&&&> Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . <&&&> Yes . Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape . <&&&> Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . <&&&> This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . Hello , can I help you ? <&&&> Yes .

I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job . I showed them to the Great Wall , the Imperial Palace , and the Summer Palace . <&&&> Then you may know that it's hard work . <&&&> Yes , I know . A friend of mine is a guide . He talked with me about his work , but I don't mind working hard . Excuse me , Miss . The total works wrong . What are these extra charges ? <&&&> There's a 20 percent service charge in this hotel . <&&&> Well . What's this 138 dollars charge then ? Excuse me , sir . Can I help you ? <&&&> I'd be glad to have your help . Could you make the air-conditioner cooler ? <&&&> I'm sorry . We can not regulate the air-conditioner . As soon as the plane takes off we'll be able to get better ventilation , and the temperature here will drop . Let me get a wet towel for you at the moment . <&&&> Good idea . <&&&> Your wet towel , sir . Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? <&&&> Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . <&&&> And , her lips ? <&&&> Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . <&&&> And her voice like a lark's song ? Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> I'd like a table for two , please . <&&&> Do you have a reservation , sir ? <&&&> No , I'm afraid not . Can I sit over there ? There's a table free by the window . <&&&> Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? <&&&> Fine . I'll sit here . <&&&> Would you like some drinks ? Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? <&&&> No . What ? <&&&> He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . How is everything going with your girlfriend ? <&&&> Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! <&&&> Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? <&&&> It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! <&&&> Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? <&&&> No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! <&&&> What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? <&&&> I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . <&&&> I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! Hello , there . You are looking a little confused ; can I help you with something ? <&&&> Well , I've always used the Bank Book , but now I have this card . I don't know how to use it in the machine . <&&&> Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving .

Hello , Dana Okro . <&&&> Hello , Dana , this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp . I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon . What do you think of the test ? Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? <&&&> No , I assure you . <&&&> And you'll repair the television , won't you ? <&&&> Ok . <&&&> Do you promise ? <&&&> Of course . <&&&> And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? Hello , Vicki . Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? <&&&> Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . <&&&> You are kidding , but she's so helpful . <&&&> Tom ... you are her boss , you kown.Of course , she's helpful to you . Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? <&&&> I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . <&&&> What do you think is the biggest change ? <&&&> Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . <&&&> That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . <&&&> Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? <&&&> I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . <&&&> That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds . <&&&> Oh , really ? <&&&> The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too . <&&&> Well , it's a good thing for you . <&&&> Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . <&&&> So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? <&&&> I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . <&&&> junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat . <&&&> But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous . Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? <&&&> What do you want to know ? Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? <&&&> Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . <&&&> That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? <&&&> Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . <&&&> True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . Hi ! Good morning , Sarah ! <&&&> Good morning , Dr Lee . <&&&> I have not seen you for a long time .

But I ’ m working on it . is that your rabbit ? <&&&> yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . <&&&> that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . <&&&> well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . <&&&> rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? <&&&> if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . <&&&> i didn't know that . Are rabbits difficult to take care of ? <&&&> not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its <&&&> that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? <&&&> No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . <&&&> can you train a rabbit to do things ? <&&&> you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on .

She recommended I sign up for this service too . <&&&> That was a wise decision , if I may say so .

Who will be driving it ? I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic . <&&&> Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . <&&&> Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . Have you seen the movie Batwoman ? <&&&> No , not yet .

This is Bell Canada . How can I help you ? <&&&> Hi . This is Amy Yang . I ’ m calling for a home phone cancellation . I ’ m moving out next month . <&&&> Okay . What day would you want your home phone cancelled ? <&&&> The end of this month . <&&&> All right . I ’ ll do it for you by then . Anything else ? Is our destination the amusement park ? David , would you like something to eat ? <&&&> No , I'm full . <&&&> Do you want something to drink ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like some coffee . <&&&> Sorry , I don't have any coffee . <&&&> That's OK . I'll have a glass of water . <&&&> A small glass , or a big one ? Oh , no ! My stub ! I can't believe it — I flushed it down the toilet ! <&&&> Excuse me , madam ! You parked in the handicapped spot . <&&&> But , but ... it was really an emergency ! And , my stub ... Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? <&&&> Coming as ? <&&&> Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! <&&&> Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . <&&&> Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? <&&&> Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . <&&&> Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? <&&&> Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . <&&&> Feed them ? <&&&> Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . <&&&> And then later everyone eats the food ? <&&&> Yes ! How did you guess that ? Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? <&&&> Not really ! I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . <&&&> Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . <&&&> Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . <&&&> Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . <&&&> With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . <&&&> Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . Excuse me . I want to pay the bill . <&&&> Please wait till your name is called . OK . Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan . Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . <&&&> Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? <&&&> Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . <&&&> I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . <&&&> Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . Hello , who is speaking , please ? <&&&> Hello , Mr . Stern . This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency .

Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? <&&&> that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director .

But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner <&&&> And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? <&&&> They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce <&&&> But they aren't as light , right ? <&&&> That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . <&&&> That's what I want.For exercising at the club . I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . <&&&> But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . <&&&> My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too . <&&&> Well , do what you like.There are different kinds of New Balance shoes though.You don't have to buy the most expensive . <&&&> I want the best.My sister said good shoes are very important . For support . They support your feet . <&&&> Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ? <&&&> No , but she exercises more than me . <&&&> I really think you are stubborn about some things.But here . Let's look at the New Balance shoes . <&&&> Here it is . This is what my sister has . Excuse me . I think I have got lost in the Art Gallery . Can you tell me the way to the exit . <&&&> Sure .

Why did you buy a brick ? <&&&> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . <&&&> And ? <&&&> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . <&&&> And it's a brick ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? <&&&> I wanted to .

Should I heat the wok ? <&&&> Yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . <&&&> What about the chicken ? <&&&> That needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . <&&&> How about the rice ?

I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . <&&&> Wow . You look great . <&&&> Thanks for noticing . <&&&> What type of diet were you on ? <&&&> I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . <&&&> That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? <&&&> Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . <&&&> That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? <&&&> Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . <&&&> That makes sense . I'm going to try that .

With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... <&&&> Isn't that a good thing ?

It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . <&&&> Yes . Will it hurt us ? <&&&> I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . <&&&> OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . <&&&> I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . <&&&> I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . <&&&> You have some doubts about our products , I understand . <&&&> I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . <&&&> Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . <&&&> Yes , of course . <&&&> Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . <&&&> And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . <&&&> That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . <&&&> So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . <&&&> Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . <&&&> I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . What can I do ? <&&&> The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet . <&&&> Did you go to any illegal website ? <&&&> No , But does that matter ? <&&&> Yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . <&&&> I see . I'd better never try . <&&&> That's wise . <&&&> Do you know what's wrong with my PC ? <&&&> One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software . <&&&> Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ? <&&&> Of course . You'd better learn something about it . <&&&> I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ? <&&&> Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? You taught at a local school for a year , right ? <&&&> Yes , I was there as an English teacher . <&&&> Did you enjoy yourself there ? <&&&> Sure . I was fond of those lovely children <&&&> So why did you decide to resign ? <&&&> The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather . <&&&> I see . But why don't you continue to work as a teacher ? <&&&> I think it's better for me to meet new challenges in life . <&&&> So you can have more room for development . <&&&> And I can experience another kind of life style . <&&&> It sounds like a good idea . Hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? <&&&> I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . <&&&> Oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? <&&&> We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air . <&&&> Wonderful ! I think that's a great idea How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! <&&&> Tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? <&&&> Perfect . I'II start preparing tomorrow . If we re going to drive , l'II need to fill up the tank . I often go to a place of leisure . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine . <&&&> Sounds great . <&&&> The coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there . <&&&> How nice . <&&&> I may take you there some day . You look a bit under the weather . <&&&> I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around . <&&&> I know that it ’ s going around the dorms . <&&&> My boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . Maybe he passed it on to me . <&&&> I have some cold tablets if you would like one . <&&&> Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup . May I help you , sir ? <&&&> I'd like to buy a shirt . <&&&> What color do you want ? Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ? <&&&> I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year . <&&&> That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show . <&&&> Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? <&&&> No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing . <&&&> Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me . Susan ? What brings you here today ? <&&&> Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . <&&&> Really ? So what ’ s the news ? The tea smells good . What tea is it ? <&&&> It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . <&&&> What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? <&&&> You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . <&&&> They must have some special methods to do this during the process . <&&&> Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . <&&&> Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? <&&&> Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . <&&&> What's the advantage about tea ? <&&&> There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . <&&&> Does that mean the stronger the better ? <&&&> No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . <&&&> Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? <&&&> It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . <&&&> Why ? You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . <&&&> I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . <&&&> As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . <&&&> Does this title come with an increase in salary ? Happy new year ! Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . <&&&> Thanks ! <&&&> Are you applying to study or work abroad ? <&&&> I want to study abroad . <&&&> What do you want to study ? <&&&> I hope to study English literature . <&&&> Have you got your visa yet ? <&&&> Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today . <&&&> I see . Is it your first interview ? <&&&> No , I've already been to here for three interviews . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> I was denied a visa ? <&&&> Why ? OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . <&&&> Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof . <&&&> Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! <&&&> Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! <&&&> OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . <&&&> The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! One Grand Slam breakfast for you ! <&&&> Thanks . You know , I just noticed that these eggs are fried , and I ordered scrambled . <&&&> Thank you for pointing that out . I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast . <&&&> Not a problem . I can just trade my plate with his . <&&&> A special order of banana pancakes for you ! <&&&> Pancakes ? I don't like pancakes . I ordered waffles . <&&&> I am so sorry , madam ! <&&&> I can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles . <&&&> I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I want to buy a suit . Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . <&&&> Come on , just a little piece . <&&&> Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? <&&&> I have no idea . <&&&> Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . <&&&> That's amazing . <&&&> If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash . <&&&> OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned . <&&&> That's OK . But that must be costly . <&&&> Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' . <&&&> Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer . <&&&> Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually . <&&&> I see . The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash . <&&&> Never mind . You can leave them to me . <&&&> Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing . Does your company have a large population ? hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? <&&&> it was wonderful , but I was so tired . <&&&> did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? <&&&> yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . <&&&> what else did you see ? <&&&> art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . <&&&> you must have had a great time . <&&&> yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . <&&&> yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? <&&&> I'm just watching some television . <&&&> I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . <&&&> Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? <&&&> I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . <&&&> That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? <&&&> That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . <&&&> I like to play the piano for fun . <&&&> Yeah . That can be a good hobby . Hey , I'm hungry . How about you ? <&&&> Yeah , I can really go for some Chinese food right now . Have you had enough time to look over the menu ? <&&&> Yes , we are almost ready to order . <&&&> Let me remind you of the specials of the day , which are posted on the board . <&&&> Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ? <&&&> Yes , we would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs . It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . <&&&> That's pretty advanced . <&&&> Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . <&&&> Is that where you park ? <&&&> Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . <&&&> Thank you . Where is your key ? <&&&> There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . <&&&> That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . <&&&> Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . <&&&> Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . <&&&> Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? <&&&> Here it is , and here we are . <&&&> When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . Excuse me , driver . Does this bus go to the museum ? <&&&> Yes , you get off at the square . <&&&> How long is the ride ? <&&&> Well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy . <&&&> Thank you.How much is the fare ? <&&&> Drop 50 cents in the box , please . Can I help you ? <&&&> How much is this pen ? <&&&> Ten Yuan . <&&&> And how much is this pencil ? <&&&> One Yuan . <&&&> Here's fifteen Yuan . <&&&> And here's your change . Please check if it is correct . <&&&> OK , that's right . What's good today ? <&&&> The salmon is good toady , it's very fresh . <&&&> How is it done ? <&&&> It's cooked with lemon and savored with rice . <&&&> Sound nice , I will try it . Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? Rebecca Johnson speaking . <&&&> I'd like to speak to someone in your Accounts Department , please . <&&&> Just a moment ... I'm afraid there's nobody there right now . Could I take a message ? <&&&> Yes , please . My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments . <&&&> Sorry , just a moment . The name is Caxton ... <&&&> No , it's Caxton . <&&&> Fine , I've got that . And your company is ... <&&&> Rosedale Investments . <&&&> Could you spell that , please ? <&&&> It's R , O , S , E , D , A , L , E . <&&&> Thank you . And the message ? <&&&> It's about an invoice which is wrong . <&&&> Have you got the number there ? Can we have two tickets for this evening's film ? <&&&> Sure.Which one ? <&&&> Titanic . Why do you want to be a teacher ? Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . <&&&> Oh , How annoying ! That guy's manner really turns me off . <&&&> Yeah.He never stops asking questions . The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . <&&&> Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? <&&&> I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . <&&&> I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? <&&&> I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? <&&&> I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? I love ice cream . John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . <&&&> Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . <&&&> No . Come here right now . <&&&> OK . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . <&&&> Why ? I work very hard . <&&&> Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? <&&&> Awful . It was a complete waste of time . <&&&> Why ? What was it about ? <&&&> It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . I've got a complaint about the noise next door . <&&&> Yes , it's most irritating . <&&&> Some people aren't very considerate . <&&&> We're going to do something about it . <&&&> Yes , I think so . <&&&> We can't put up with it any more . <&&&> We'll play the CD loud , is that all right ? <&&&> I don't think so . Will you be done doing my hair soon ? How are your Chinese and English ? <&&&> I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . <&&&> How would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes .

Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? <&&&> Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! <&&&> Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . <&&&> I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? <&&&> Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . <&&&> So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? <&&&> To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . <&&&> Like this ? <&&&> Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . <&&&> Did I do it right ?

Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . <&&&> Thank you . Oh , man .

You've already run out of all your amenities ? <&&&> No , I still have plenty left , even if I took three baths a day . <&&&> I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ? <&&&> I need to take home some souvenirs ! Who's that over here ? <&&&> That's the new teacher . <&&&> What do you think of the teacher ? <&&&> She's very nice . <&&&> What does she teach ? <&&&> English , of course . <&&&> Is she your teacher ? <&&&> Yes . She teaches our class three times a week . I found an apartment to rent . <&&&> Where did you find this apartment ? <&&&> I found it in today ’ s apartment ads . <&&&> Really ?

Hello , this is the International Student Office . My name is Leah . How may I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to speak to the Ms . Collins , please . Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? <&&&> We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef . You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! <&&&> Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . <&&&> Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! <&&&> Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . <&&&> Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . <&&&> Why do you say so ? you look better today . How did your test go ? <&&&> much better than it did yesterday . <&&&> did you pass ? <&&&> I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! <&&&> you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . <&&&> thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . <&&&> you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . <&&&> did you always do well at school ? <&&&> no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . <&&&> really ? <&&&> sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? Hey , what's up ? <&&&> Oh , nothing . <&&&> What were you writing ? <&&&> ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . <&&&> You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! <&&&> I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . <&&&> But , you work with her everyday . <&&&> That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . <&&&> You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? <&&&> Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . <&&&> It ’ s a typical of them to do so . Guess what came in the mail today ? <&&&> What ? <&&&> My acceptance letter to Yale ! <&&&> Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? <&&&> Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . <&&&> You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . <&&&> When can you do that ? <&&&> Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? <&&&> Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? <&&&> Alright . Do you have a coin ? <&&&> Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . <&&&> Heads . <&&&> Sorry , it's tails . You lose . <&&&> Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . <&&&> Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? <&&&> No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . <&&&> Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . <&&&> Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? <&&&> Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? <&&&> Yes , I agree . <&&&> So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . <&&&> Alright . <&&&> I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . <&&&> Is that right ? I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? <&&&> Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . <&&&> I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? <&&&> Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . <&&&> You mean you didn't know much English then ? <&&&> Right . I only knew a few English sentences . <&&&> That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? <&&&> First , I worked as a servant . <&&&> Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? <&&&> Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . <&&&> Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . <&&&> Is it gonna hurt ? <&&&> No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . I know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years , can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us ? <&&&> Because the job I am doing in my present company is of no challenge , but I like challenge.Your firm is a young organisation with many innovative ideas . It has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . Good morning , sir . How may I help you ? <&&&> Good morning ! Do you have any rooms available at the moment ? <&&&> Yes , we do . What kind of room would you like ? <&&&> I'd like a suite for four nights . <&&&> Please wait a moment while I check availability . Ah , I'm sorry , sir . We only have a double room available now . <&&&> That's all right . How much do they cost ? <&&&> Each night costs 320 RIB , but for a four night stay , we can offer a discount of 15 % . What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? <&&&> Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . <&&&> I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? <&&&> In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . <&&&> Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! <&&&> A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? <&&&> I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . <&&&> Exactly . <&&&> So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? <&&&> They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . <&&&> In what way ? <&&&> Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . <&&&> You are making me feel really discouraged . Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S .. <&&&> Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you . This is IBA Bank , Claire speaking , how may I help you ? <&&&> Oh , hello , yes , arm ... I've just lost my bank stuff . <&&&> I'm sorry , could you be a little more specific ? <&&&> You know my bank stuff . My card , my book ... <&&&> OK , I will have to take some details from you . Could you tell me your name , please ? <&&&> Jim Chan . The account's in my name . Is that all you need to know ? How are the children doing at sport ? <&&&> I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . <&&&> He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? <&&&> He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi <&&&> Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? <&&&> The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . <&&&> You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . <&&&> I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . <&&&> Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . <&&&> I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . <&&&> You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . <&&&> Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . <&&&> In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . <&&&> Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? Your house is very old . Does it need redecorating ? <&&&> Yes , it really needs redecorating . <&&&> Shall I help you with it ? I really appreciate your driving me around . <&&&> It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . <&&&> It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all . <&&&> So what do you see in there ? <&&&> This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . <&&&> Can you afford that much ? <&&&> No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency . <&&&> Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person . <&&&> How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ? <&&&> That means the apartment has furniture in it . <&&&> That's good . <&&&> Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture . <&&&> Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 . <&&&> It's still pretty expensive . <&&&> Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one . <&&&> Alright . What's the phone number ? <&&&> 256-7797 . <&&&> Got it . What else do you see ? One of my students told me she was very depressed today . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Her father is dying . <&&&> Oh , that ’ s very sad . Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ? <&&&> I'd like that very much . I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington . I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute . <&&&> But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before ! <&&&> It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . <&&&> So the company will pay for everything ? <&&&> Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . <&&&> That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? Don't you ever cheat on me . <&&&> Why would I do that ? <&&&> Because men like to cheat . <&&&> Some men do , but not me . <&&&> I'm watching you . <&&&> I'm an open book . Watch me all you want . <&&&> If I catch you , you'll be sorry . <&&&> You won't catch me , because I love you . I'm not a cheater . <&&&> I will poke your eyes out . Do you mind if I ask your friend out ? <&&&> Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends . <&&&> Okay , that's good . You must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after <&&&> Yes . But I don't know the exact time . <&&&> The operation starts at 10 0 ' clock . But you'll get an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . If your family comes to see you before the operation , they should come before 8: 30 . <&&&> Oh , I see . I will tell my wife . Thank you for telling me so much . <&&&> It's nothing . Did your doctor explain to you about what operation you are going to have ? <&&&> Yes , of course . I am going to have my appendix removed . Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! <&&&> Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . <&&&> Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? <&&&> I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . <&&&> As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . <&&&> True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? Did you hear that they are going to start an exercise class after work ? <&&&> Oh really ? When is it going to start ? <&&&> Next month . I think . Are you going to sign up ? Did you take the job ? <&&&> No . Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking . May I take your order ? <&&&> Um yes , I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . Did you hear who won the election ? Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? <&&&> Sorry , I thought you knew . <&&&> But you should have told me you were in love with her . Hello . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? <&&&> Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? <&&&> What ’ s this form for ? <&&&> This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . Can we talk ? <&&&> What about ? <&&&> I ’ m not too clear on some things about my lease . <&&&> Is there a problem ? <&&&> How many years is my lease for ? <&&&> In three years your lease will be up . <&&&> Can I move out before those three years ? <&&&> If you do , I will keep your deductible . <&&&> Why would you keep it ? <&&&> I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract . <&&&> I get it now . Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling . <&&&> Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore ! <&&&> Do not worry . Today will be easier . <&&&> Beth , what date is today ? <&&&> Today is Saturday . <&&&> What is the date today ? <&&&> Today is July 4th . <&&&> Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday . <&&&> Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day . <&&&> Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? <&&&> It is December 25th . <&&&> Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . <&&&> Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? <&&&> April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! <&&&> That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . <&&&> Thanks . <&&&> After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 <&&&> I guess so . I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . <&&&> Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . <&&&> You've had a good trip , I hope . <&&&> Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . Can you lend me fifty bucks ? <&&&> What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . <&&&> Where are you going ? <&&&> I have a big date tonight . <&&&> You have got a car , haven ’ t you ? what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? <&&&> I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? <&&&> I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . <&&&> I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . <&&&> yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! <&&&> right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . <&&&> in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . <&&&> that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? <&&&> no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? What did you do last vacation ? <&&&> I learned to drive and I got a driving license . Hello . I'd like to get a seat to New York City on a flight leaving sometime before this Friday . <&&&> I'm afraid Thera isn't any direct light before Friday . What about a non-direct one ? You have to make a change in Detroit . <&&&> Well , in that case , that's fine . I want a first class ticket on Thursday . John , you have done a good job . Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contracts with our company . You really did a good job . <&&&> Thank you . I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users . <&&&> Hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best . <&&&> I am flattered . But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . She asked me to her office . So you're traveling around the world , aren't you . <&&&> That's right <&&&> When did you arrive here ? Excuse me , Is there a hotel nearby ? <&&&> The nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here . <&&&> how can I get there ? Honey , would you marry me ? <&&&> I want to think about it for some time . <&&&> Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times . <&&&> I know . But your way doesn't touch my heart . <&&&> Oh , god , please tell me how . <&&&> I can't tell you . Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? <&&&> We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . <&&&> I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? <&&&> I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . <&&&> To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . <&&&> Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . <&&&> Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . What do you think this flat ? <&&&> It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us . <&&&> Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think . <&&&> But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . <&&&> That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine . I would like to open an account today . <&&&> What kind ? What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? <&&&> I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? <&&&> I don't know . I failed my exam . <&&&> What did you get ? <&&&> A B plus . <&&&> That's not bad . <&&&> But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! <&&&> Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? <&&&> No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . <&&&> I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? <&&&> What ? <&&&> You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . <&&&> How ? <&&&> Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . <&&&> Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . <&&&> Then go to bed and have a good sleep . <&&&> I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . <&&&> Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! Here we are . This is Wangfujing Street . <&&&> Thank you . How much is it ? Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book ! How are the children doing at sport ? <&&&> I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . <&&&> He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? <&&&> He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi <&&&> Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? <&&&> The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . <&&&> How are they at swimming ? <&&&> They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . <&&&> Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . Hi , Daisy ! <&&&> Hi Simon . Nice to meet you again <&&&> I hope you are Settling in at school ! <&&&> I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses . <&&&> Good ! Me too ! By the way . you didn't tell me what you are studying here . <&&&> Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies . <&&&> Really ? That's great . You hope to join a company after graduating ? <&&&> Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really . <&&&> What about your friend Zoe <&&&> She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy . What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? <&&&> Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . <&&&> What commission terms can you offer ? I think you are an excellent person . Honestly speaking , you are very suitable for this job <&&&> Thank you very much for your evaluation . I also like this job very much . <&&&> I want to know your earliest available entry time . <&&&> Oh , let me think ... Maybe two months later . <&&&> It's too late . If you could get the job , could you start a little earlier ? <&&&> I'm sorry I can't , because I haven't finished my thesis . <&&&> What a pity ! <&&&> When do you usually require the new employee to start ? <&&&> Within two weeks , because the new employees need to receive induction training . <&&&> I will make an arrangement for it . <&&&> I hope you can come to our company to work . Hello , this is Francis . <&&&> Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . May I help you , Miss ? <&&&> Yes , I'm excited to hear about your new product . <&&&> OK . I'm sure you will love what this new automatic answering system can do for your business . <&&&> Yes . I've heard a lot about it . <&&&> Watch our computer demonstration , please . You'll be convinced that our product is superior . ( After the demonstration ) <&&&> Yes , I would have to agree with you . It seems to offer more options than the others . But new product sometimes has a few troubles . How about yours ? What kind of personality do you think you have ? <&&&> I am quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving things half done . <&&&> Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? <&&&> I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . <&&&> What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? <&&&> I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live alt by himself , I think . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the better . You are from the travel agency , aren't you ? <&&&> Yes , are you Mr James ? <&&&> Yes , I am . Are you Miss Li from the travel agency ? <&&&> That's right . Can you make the tea , Sam ? Are you going to vote ? <&&&> I am . Are you ? <&&&> Yes , and for the first time . <&&&> Is that right ? <&&&> I don ’ t know how to vote . I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . <&&&> Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? <&&&> Nonsmoking , please . <&&&> All right . May I have your name ? Hi , I'd like two tickets to Providence , please . <&&&> Sure , what time will you like to depart ? <&&&> What time does the next train leave ? <&&&> Actually , one just left ten minutes ago . The next one is at two forty-five , debates at five thirty-five . Will you be voting ? <&&&> I will . Will you be voting ? <&&&> Well , when is the election ? <&&&> You don ’ t know that ? <&&&> I just don ’ t know . <&&&> It ’ s this Tuesday . What are we going to eat for dinner ? <&&&> Are you going to cook anything ? <&&&> I didn't plan on cooking tonight . <&&&> If you're hungry , then cook something . <&&&> I don't know what to make . I need help with my timesheet . <&&&> OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ? <&&&> Yes , I have seen them . <&&&> Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ? <&&&> Yes , I understand what to do . <&&&> You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ? <&&&> What ? Huh ? <&&&> So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ? What is your great struck ? Did you see who the suspect was ? <&&&> I got a perfect look at the suspect . <&&&> Would you be able to pick him out of a line-up ? <&&&> That'll be easy . <&&&> Please take a careful look at these five men . Good morning , my name is Martin . You've applied for the Laboratory Assistant's position , right ? <&&&> Yes . When I saw the advertisement I thought it would really suit me . <&&&> Can you tell me why you replied to our advertisement ? <&&&> I think that I'll be really good at this kind of work . In fact I learn so fast that I'll be looking for promotion very shortly . <&&&> Do you know exactly what you would be doing as a Laboratory Assistant ? <&&&> A laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment , keep a check on the supplies in the store , and prepare the chemicals for experiments . <&&&> What sort of student do you regard yourself as ? Did you enjoy studying while you were at school ? <&&&> I suppose I'm a reasonable student . I passed all my tests and enjoyed studying subjects that interested me . <&&&> What were your favorite subjects at school ? <&&&> Maths and chemistry were my favorite subjects at school . I also enjoyed history . <&&&> Do you have any plans for further study ? <&&&> Well , I've thought about doing the part-time Chemistry Certificate course at Technical College . I think I would really benefit from doing that . <&&&> Have you ever had a job before ? <&&&> Yes . I have worked part-time at a take away food store-the one just round the corner . <&&&> We have a lot of other applicants for this position . Why do you think that you deserve to get the job ? <&&&> Well , I've found out a lot about this type of work and my research suggests that I would be quite capable of doing the work involved . I also think that I would be able to handle any training course reasonably well . What are you doing this weekend ? <&&&> I am not sure . What are you doing ? <&&&> I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . <&&&> That sounds like a great idea ! <&&&> Would you be interested in joining me ? How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? <&&&> Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . <&&&> I never eat breakfast though . <&&&> That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won't expect your body to work without food . <&&&> I never thought about it that way . <&&&> I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . <&&&> Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . <&&&> Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . Did your meal meet with your approval ? <&&&> Our meal was absolutely perfect ! <&&&> How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ? What a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! <&&&> That would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . <&&&> All right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . <&&&> Thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? <&&&> No problem . <&&&> Now let's have one together . <&&&> Do you know how to set up the timer ? Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ? <&&&> Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ? <&&&> How about tomorrow afternoon ? <&&&> Sure . Where shall I meet you ? <&&&> At the gate of the park . <&&&> Great . I look forward to meeting you . <&&&> See you then . Do you have a free moment ? <&&&> Sure , what do you need ? <&&&> I am having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? <&&&> Well . First you have to turn this switch on . <&&&> Silly me . What dressing would you like on the salad ? <&&&> French dressing , please . I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? <&&&> Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? <&&&> I want to have a foot massage and a haircut . <&&&> A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . <&&&> Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures . <&&&> This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor ! <&&&> I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? <&&&> Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . <&&&> Maybe we should try a thai massage too . Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . Front desk . May I help you ? <&&&> I ’ m going to check out tomorrow . Then we ’ ll be back in a week ’ s time . Can I leave my luggage here . <&&&> Yes . Sure . You do have storage service . When will be checking out tomorrow ? <&&&> About nine thirty in the morning . Good afternoon , need any help ? Are you going home now ? <&&&> No , I'm not . <&&&> What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? <&&&> No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . <&&&> An apartment ? Why ? <&&&> I'm going to try to find a place near the office . <&&&> Where are you living now ? <&&&> Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day . <&&&> How are you going to find an apartment ? Do you want to buy something here ? I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? <&&&> Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . <&&&> And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? <&&&> Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . <&&&> Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? <&&&> As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . <&&&> That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . <&&&> It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . <&&&> So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . <&&&> I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . <&&&> don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . <&&&> All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession . <&&&> Have you received any other honors ? <&&&> Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Ten Prominent Youths of Beijing ' in 2002 . <&&&> Do you have anything published ? the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . <&&&> that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . <&&&> great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . <&&&> do you prefer brandy or ports . <&&&> port , please . <&&&> excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . <&&&> the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? <&&&> yes . You always have a good nose for wines . <&&&> next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . <&&&> oh , what's that ? <&&&> it's made from naturally frozen grapes . <&&&> why not ? It sounds great . <&&&> oh , here's to your health . <&&&> thanks . Cheers . What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? <&&&> Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' . <&&&> Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . May I help you ? <&&&> What time will the library be closing ? <&&&> It closes at six . <&&&> Does it always close at six ? <&&&> No , not every day . <&&&> Will the library be open on Saturday ? <&&&> Absolutely . <&&&> What are your hours on Saturday ? <&&&> Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . <&&&> All right . Thank you . You know that this job requires frequent business travel . Can you accept it ? <&&&> Yes , I can . <&&&> Mostly short business trips , but sometimes long ones are also needed . <&&&> Then how about the expenses during the trips ? <&&&> The company will pay all the expenses . <&&&> Would you tell me where we often travel ? <&&&> Usually Shanghai , Qingdao , Hong Kong and so on . I have a problem . <&&&> What's the problem ? <&&&> My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . <&&&> Is there a problem ? <&&&> The delivery people showed up four hours late . <&&&> I apologize for their tardiness . <&&&> I was late for work because of them . <&&&> Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? <&&&> Yeah , I just got back this morning . <&&&> That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? <&&&> Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . <&&&> Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . <&&&> Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . <&&&> I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . <&&&> I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . <&&&> We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? <&&&> It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . <&&&> Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! <&&&> I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . <&&&> Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? <&&&> What is that ? <&&&> A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . Can I take your order ? <&&&> I'll take two value meals . <&&&> What kind of drink do you want with those ? <&&&> One Coke and the other a Sprite , please . <&&&> You can super-size your meal for only 39 cents extra . <&&&> Yes , I'd like that , then . Hi . Are you new in this class ? <&&&> Yes , I am . I really don ’ t know anyone . Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . What a beautiful day ! <&&&> The weather is so crazy . It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning . <&&&> I was worried about canceling the climbing . <&&&> Honey , wait for me . I am too tired to move a step further . <&&&> What about taking the cable car ? <&&&> Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking . There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall . <&&&> Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ? <&&&> Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price . <&&&> Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday . <&&&> Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet . <&&&> Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that . Did you move into your new apartment ? <&&&> Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am . <&&&> No kidding . Time is running out . <&&&> It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters . Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! <&&&> I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! <&&&> Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... What did you do last night ? <&&&> I just stayed at home and watched TV . <&&&> Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? <&&&> Yes , it was a very evenly matched game . <&&&> What were the results of the game ? <&&&> It ended in a tie . <&&&> What was the actual score ? <&&&> It was three all . Do you have a boyfriend ? <&&&> Yes . Why ? <&&&> Well , I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common . <&&&> So ? <&&&> So I think I may fall in love with her . <&&&> You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? <&&&> Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? <&&&> That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . <&&&> That's what I did . <&&&> And you think about her all the time ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Can I have a look at your handworks ? <&&&> All right . This way , please . <&&&> You have quite a range , haven't you ? <&&&> Yes , sir . What do you want to do tomorrow night ? <&&&> What--is tomorrow night something special ? <&&&> It's Friday . We should go party . <&&&> I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know . <&&&> Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . <&&&> Do you feel like dancing ? <&&&> Yes ? Why not ? <&&&> Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . <&&&> They aren't alcoholic ! <&&&> No , maybe they're not . But they're close . <&&&> So where should we go ? <&&&> Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . <&&&> You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . <&&&> The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? <&&&> It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . <&&&> No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . <&&&> It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? <&&&> Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . <&&&> No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! <&&&> It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? Do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? <&&&> Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? <&&&> Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? <&&&> Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? <&&&> Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? <&&&> That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? <&&&> To be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . I've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ’ s turned up . <&&&> You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> I know you don ’ t want to pay for a job , but I think it ’ s time we consulted a headhunter . <&&&> You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either . <&&&> Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun . <&&&> Do you have anyone in mind ? <&&&> Actually I do . <&&&> Who ? Can I still catch T107 for Xiamen ? <&&&> Sorry , sir . The train has already left . <&&&> That's too bad . Can I take another train ? <&&&> Yes . Your ticket is valid for three days . <&&&> That's great ! I will take the next train . <&&&> You have to have your ticket checked . <&&&> Shall I pay extra charge ? Did you enjoy your meal ? <&&&> Yes , we really enjoyed it . <&&&> May I interest you in some dessert ? <&&&> Yes , that sounds great . <&&&> Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials . I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ? <&&&> No problem . What are you looking for ? <&&&> My laptop , do you see it ? <&&&> Yes , your laptop is on the chair . <&&&> Where's my book ? <&&&> Which one ? <&&&> The dictionary . <&&&> It's under the table . <&&&> Where's my pencil ? <&&&> There's a pencil in front of the lamp . Mr Ludlow , hello . It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? Do you have a bf ? <&&&> Yes , I had a bf before . <&&&> Why you say bf before ? <&&&> We parted from each other last month . <&&&> Have you got a new one ? <&&&> Mmmm , no . How about you ? <&&&> I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . <&&&> Haha , so you are my E-bf . <&&&> I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? <&&&> Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . <&&&> Wow ! Blablablabla . . . <&&&> Hey ! What is it ? <&&&> I am flying like a bird . <&&&> LL <&&&> I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . <&&&> I have no champagne right now . How about this ? <&&&> It's OK , so I send you this . <&&&> Is it made of chocolate ? Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? <&&&> No . What ? <&&&> He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . <&&&> No . Really , what happened ? <&&&> Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . <&&&> Was he out with the guys from the bank ? <&&&> Yes , I think so . Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ? <&&&> Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house . <&&&> Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from .

This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps . <&&&> I have no idea what kbps means .

I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . <&&&> Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy .

Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? <&&&> Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . <&&&> Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . <&&&> That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . Good evening .

Now there is a table available in non-smoking section . Please follow me . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> This is the menu . Are you ready to order now ? <&&&> Well , I think I'd like to have a tomato sausage soup first . And the same for him , please . <&&&> Yes , and what would you like to drink ? <&&&> One goblet of red wine and one bottle of beer please . <&&&> Would you like a dessert ? <&&&> What special kind of desserts do you have ?

Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? <&&&> We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . <&&&> I didn't know that .

Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ? <&&&> I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college .

Gordon , you're ever so late . <&&&> Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . do you have s second ? <&&&> sure . What do you want ? <&&&> I want to tell you I've put in my notice . What's the cost of the trousers ? <&&&> $ 90 . Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out ! <&&&> Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! <&&&> Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ?

I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . <&&&> Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ? <&&&> We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . I think you will be interested in some of our new products . We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers . <&&&> We're thinking of ordering some special styles of summer clothes . We should be interested in your products if they are of the styles we want . The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! <&&&> Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . <&&&> That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! <&&&> Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . <&&&> Be brave , sir .

I spent the weekend at beach . <&&&> That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . <&&&> Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time . <&&&> To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too . Hi , I ’ d like to have my phone turned on , please . <&&&> At what address , sir ? <&&&> 345 Lincoln Avenue . Oklahoma City . <&&&> O . K . Your name please ? <&&&> John Smith . <&&&> One moment please . Very well , Mr . Smith . I need to ask you a few questions .

What seems to be the matter ? <&&&> I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now . <&&&> What are your symptoms ? <&&&> I feel chilly , I've got cramps , I keep throwing up , and I feel dizzy and tired . <&&&> It sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ? <&&&> Yes . I can't seem to drink enough . <&&&> Have you been drinking plenty of water ? <&&&> No , just soda . <&&&> Ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse . <&&&> That seems to be a bit low , but that's not uncommon when you're ill . <&&&> Is anyone else sick in your home ? <&&&> No , but my girlfriend has mono . <&&&> I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The nurse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us by this afternoon . What did you do over the weekend ? <&&&> I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . <&&&> Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? <&&&> It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . <&&&> Like what ? <&&&> Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . <&&&> What else can we do to protect the environment ? <&&&> If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . <&&&> How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? <&&&> Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . <&&&> What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . <&&&> I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . <&&&> Oh , that's too bad . Where can you park around here ? Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I sent in my resume at the end of last week . I'm applying for the accounts assistant position . <&&&> May I have your name please ? <&&&> My name is Judy Liao . That's spelled L I A O . <&&&> Alright ... And did you have some specific questions about your application ? <&&&> Not really . I was in the neighborhood , and I just wanted to stop in to see if you received my resume . <&&&> Oh , that's no problem . Just give me a moment , and I can check.Judy Liao . Let's see ... Yes , here it is . Judy Liao . We have received your resume . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Is there anything else I can help you with ? <&&&> Yes , maybe . The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume , a cover letter , and two letters of recommendation . I included those things in the envelope . Is there anything else I should send ? <&&&> No , that is all we need . If we have those things included , that is sufficient . <&&&> Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job ? <&&&> I'm not really sure about that . But I know we are still receiving resumes.Maybe after a week or two they will start calling applicants . <&&&> I see . Well , thank you very much for helping me . You have been very helpful . <&&&> If you have any further questions , you can call any time . <&&&> Thank you . Honey , would you marry me ? <&&&> I want to think about it for some time . <&&&> Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times . Which film shall we see ? <&&&> There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . <&&&> My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . <&&&> That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? <&&&> Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . <&&&> So , what did you get them ? <&&&> I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . I have a feeling you will get this job . <&&&> Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . I want to go try on these clothes . <&&&> What did you find ? <&&&> I found some jeans , and a new blouse . <&&&> Go and try it on . <&&&> What do you think ? <&&&> I love that shirt on you . <&&&> What about the jeans ?

I got back only yesterday . <&&&> Did you enjoy yourself ? <&&&> Very much.New York is such a nice place.Shall I show you some photographs ? The city has got a traffic problem . <&&&> That means it's developing very fast . Did you get my email ? <&&&> I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> How did the business trip go ? <&&&> Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . <&&&> I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! <&&&> I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! <&&&> Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . <&&&> I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . Excuse me , sir . <&&&> Yes ? <&&&> Is this your car ? <&&&> Yes , it is . Do you have any year-end benefits ? Can you recognize that woman , Millie ? <&&&> I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . <&&&> I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ? <&&&> That must be Conrad Reeves . <&&&> Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? <&&&> No , He must be her fourth or fifth . <&&&> Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! Can I apply for a permit today ? <&&&> I need to see your ID . <&&&> I think I forgot it in the car . <&&&> You need to give me your ID and $ 27 . <&&&> I'm going to go and get my ID from the car right now . <&&&> Go get it . <&&&> Here you go . <&&&> All right , I'm going to need you to fill this out . Jill , how do you like your new job ? <&&&> I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . <&&&> I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . <&&&> Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . <&&&> Sure , I think I know the place . <&&&> Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day . <&&&> That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? <&&&> Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . <&&&> Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion . <&&&> No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes . The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it . <&&&> Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ? <&&&> Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival .

Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? <&&&> Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design <&&&> I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? <&&&> Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? <&&&> I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . <&&&> No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? <&&&> They say you shouldn't mix love and work . I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . <&&&> Does it work ? <&&&> I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . <&&&> Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? <&&&> No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . <&&&> Were you celebrating something ? Oh honey , I tell you good news . The apartment I looked at today was pretty decent , around 120 square meters . <&&&> Great . What about the surrounding area ? Life's so boring . <&&&> Well , most of the time it is , I guess . May I order some cable from you today ? <&&&> Okay , what package would you like to order ? <&&&> I'm not sure of what packages you offer . <&&&> We offer packages with all the movie channels . <&&&> Are there any other packages ? <&&&> We also have packages with all the sports channels . <&&&> I want a package that has the basic and movie channels . <&&&> We have that available . Hello Mary . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Are you still seeing Paul ? <&&&> No . We broke up last month . I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while . <&&&> Did you break up amicably ?

We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now . <&&&> Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ? <&&&> I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . <&&&> She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon . <&&&> Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ? What kind of personality do you think you have ? <&&&> I am quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving things half done . <&&&> Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? <&&&> I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . <&&&> What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? <&&&> I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live alt by himself , I think . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the better . <&&&> What kind of people do you like to work with ? <&&&> People who are honest , dedicate to their work and have integrity . what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? <&&&> it's Beethoven . Do you like it ? <&&&> I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too .

It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? <&&&> There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . <&&&> The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... <&&&> No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . <&&&> Is it expensive to ride on the underground ?

I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . <&&&> What kind of work ? <&&&> I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutical company . <&&&> What do you do there ? Good morning , welcome aboard . Do you know how the national flag of Canada looks like ? <&&&> I don't know . I need to buy some fruit . I want to get some cable . <&&&> Do you know what package you want to get ? <&&&> What packages do you have ? <&&&> We have movie channel packages . <&&&> What else have you got ? <&&&> You can get the sports package . <&&&> Is there a package with basic and movie channels ? Welcome to Bill ’ s Fabric World . What can I do for you today ? <&&&> I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ? <&&&> Sure we do ! We have the best tailors in the country ! What is it that you need exactly ? <&&&> Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit . <&&&> Excellent ! We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.How about we get you measured ? Let ’ s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . Now , let ’ s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here . <&&&> Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? My neck gets easily irritated . <&&&> No problem ! Now for your pants , let me just measure your waist and the inseam . <&&&> You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays . This facility is great , don't you think ? <&&&> Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . <&&&> I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . <&&&> If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . <&&&> Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . <&&&> Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? <&&&> No . <&&&> That's strange . <&&&> Where do you go for lunch around here ? <&&&> Are you hungry ? <&&&> Not too bad . But I will be soon . <&&&> I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . <&&&> I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? <&&&> They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . <&&&> Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . <&&&> For whom ? Cortex ? <&&&> Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . <&&&> I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . <&&&> When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? <&&&> Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! <&&&> Hi , Alex ! <&&&> Where have you been ? As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? <&&&> That's right . Here you go . <&&&> Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... May I take your order ? <&&&> We haven't decided yet . Could you give us a little longer ? <&&&> Yes , take your time , please . <&&&> Can we get something to drink ? We want two bottles of beer . I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! <&&&> No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . <&&&> Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . <&&&> Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? <&&&> Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . <&&&> Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... <&&&> That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! <&&&> Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... <&&&> Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . <&&&> Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? <&&&> I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? <&&&> I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . <&&&> Mm-hm . How long were you there ? <&&&> I was there for almost a year . <&&&> Oh , OK . <&&&> And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . <&&&> So , did you , did you lose your finger ? <&&&> Almost . Martin ? Did you remember to bring back that software I lent you ? Is there a lot of crime in your city ? <&&&> There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . <&&&> It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . Could I order dinner ? <&&&> Of course . What would you like ? <&&&> I want a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . <&&&> I'm so sorry . We ran out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? <&&&> That's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay . <&&&> May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? <&&&> Not tonight , thank you . <&&&> No strawberries . We'll charge your amenities account , if that's okay . Good morning.My name's Pat Green . <&&&> Good morning.Mr.Green.My name is Helen.What can I do for you ? <&&&> I read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant . <&&&> Yes.Are you interested in the job ? <&&&> I think so.But before I apply , could you tell me more about the work ? <&&&> Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ? Hi , Sue . What's up ? <&&&> Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? <&&&> Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . <&&&> Really ? What's he been doing ? Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? <&&&> I've gotten a few . <&&&> How many is a few ? <&&&> I've gotten about six . <&&&> Have you paid all your tickets off ? <&&&> Yes , I've paid all of them off . <&&&> How much is the fine ? <&&&> It's like $ 130 each ticket . <&&&> That's not cheap at all . <&&&> I got a parking ticket the other day . <&&&> Pay it off , and they'll clear your record .

What position have you held before ? <&&&> I have been a salesman . <&&&> Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? <&&&> I am in charge of the trading department . <&&&> What made you decide to change your job ? <&&&> I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible . <&&&> Why do you leave your present company ? <&&&> I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . <&&&> Why did you pick this organization ? <&&&> I'm very much interested in the position . Is there any ticket for New York left ?

I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? <&&&> Oh , yes , it was very interesting . <&&&> What were the schools like ? <&&&> Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . <&&&> But you taught children , yes ? <&&&> Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . <&&&> They actually study after school ? <&&&> That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . <&&&> Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . <&&&> I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? <&&&> My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . <&&&> I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? <&&&> Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . <&&&> You need a babysitter . <&&&> Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . <&&&> I could have Suzy stay at my place . <&&&> I don't want to do that to you , Karen . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . <&&&> I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . <&&&> I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . <&&&> I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . <&&&> I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . I really want to go to the beach this weekend . <&&&> That sounds like fun . What's the weather going to be like ?

Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . <&&&> Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . <&&&> Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? <&&&> We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! <&&&> Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! <&&&> Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! <&&&> Is that why you missed work today ? <&&&> Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . <&&&> Www ! <&&&> I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again !

Don ’ t worry about it ! <&&&> What was that ? <&&&> Relax , it was just a goat ! <&&&> And that ? <&&&> It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there .

You know who won the election , right ? <&&&> I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected . <&&&> I couldn ’ t believe it , either . <&&&> He just made history . <&&&> I hope you voted for him . Could you help me to register for a class ? <&&&> Do you know what class you want to take ? <&&&> Are there any Psychology classes available ? <&&&> I believe there are still two Psychology classes open . Don't just stand outside . Come on in . <&&&> Yeah . <&&&> This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean . <&&&> Nice to meet you guys . <&&&> Over there are Stacy and Rebecca .

How do you like this waltz ? <&&&> It's very nice . I like it very much . <&&&> Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? <&&&> My pleasure .

But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? <&&&> yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ? <&&&> I was at home with my parents in New York City . <&&&> really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? <&&&> I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . <&&&> that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? <&&&> no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . <&&&> did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? <&&&> yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . <&&&> did he survive ? <&&&> unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower . <&&&> I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . <&&&> it was .

There's no phone where he's at ! Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . <&&&> Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . <&&&> Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . <&&&> That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . <&&&> What do you know ? You are over weight too . <&&&> I'm not on a diet though . <&&&> I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . Charlotte , have you had your supper ? <&&&> No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . Would you like me to type it for you ? <&&&> Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? <&&&> Not at all .

I really want to go to the beach this weekend . <&&&> That sounds like fun . What's the weather going to be like ? <&&&> I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend . <&&&> Is it going to be perfect beach weather ? <&&&> I believe so . <&&&> Good . I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend . <&&&> I know . I really want to go to the beach . <&&&> But you know that California weather is really unpredictable . <&&&> You're right . One minute it's hot , and then the next minute it's cold . <&&&> I really wish the weather would just stay the same . <&&&> I do too . That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time . What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days . <&&&> It's your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high . <&&&> And what's the cause of that ? <&&&> Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . <&&&> But I can't just slow down . <&&&> You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . <&&&> Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . <&&&> What are they ? <&&&> They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . <&&&> And what is the most important point ? Thank you for coming so quickly . <&&&> No problem . What ’ s wrong ? <&&&> A pipe in my apartment is leaking . <&&&> Where is the pipe ? <&&&> The pipe is in my bathroom . <&&&> Can you tell me how long the pipe has been leaking ? <&&&> The pipe has been leaking for a couple days . <&&&> You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe , right ? Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? <&&&> Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . <&&&> Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . <&&&> I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . <&&&> Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . <&&&> Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? <&&&> History . <&&&> Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . <&&&> Thirty percent ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? <&&&> Yes . It's an excellent system . <&&&> Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? <&&&> Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . <&&&> I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . <&&&> I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . <&&&> What ? Are you serious ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> But nobody uses Macintosh ! <&&&> That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? <&&&> Yes , I'm from Taiwan . <&&&> Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . <&&&> But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? <&&&> Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... <&&&> Did they mutiny ? <&&&> Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . <&&&> It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? <&&&> We can take a bus there . <&&&> Does this bus go there ? <&&&> I think so . <&&&> Let's step in , Dad . <&&&> No , it's too crowded . <&&&> Dad . Here comes another bus . <&&&> Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! <&&&> Why ? Dad ? That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing . <&&&> Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? <&&&> You can say that again ! <&&&> What's up with Vince and Elvin ? <&&&> They work for Zina now . We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . <&&&> Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . <&&&> You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? <&&&> To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on Adam , I'm sorry ! Mike , what are you doing tonight ? <&&&> Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . <&&&> I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . What do you do now ? <&&&> I'm out of work at the moment . Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? <&&&> Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . <&&&> How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? <&&&> They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . <&&&> Do they have any grandchildren ? That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? <&&&> Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . <&&&> I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . <&&&> He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . <&&&> Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? <&&&> I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . <&&&> We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself . Well , that was an interesting documentary ! Hi ! I'm Hong lei . What's your name ? <&&&> Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky . <&&&> Hi Ricky . Are you a new student here ? <&&&> Yes , I had my first lesson this morning . Are you a new student too ? <&&&> No , I've been here for six months . <&&&> Six months . That's a long time . <&&&> It's not so long really . What class are you in ? Intermediate or ... ? <&&&> Intermediate Three . And what about you ? <&&&> I'm in Advanced One . Who's your teacher ? <&&&> I can't remember her name , but she's got curly red hair . <&&&> Ah ! Does she wear glasses ? <&&&> Yes , I think so . <&&&> That's probably Anne Wallis . <&&&> Yes that's right . Do you know her ? Is she your teacher too ? <&&&> No . But she taught me last term . How long have you been here ? <&&&> Only a week . <&&&> Wow , not long . Where do you live ? With a family ? I need to get a taxi . <&&&> We have a variety of transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi ? Would you like to come to our party ? <&&&> I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . <&&&> What happened ? You look so pale . <&&&> It's the end of the world for me . <&&&> What makes you say that ? All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . <&&&> What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? <&&&> Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? <&&&> I suppose I do . <&&&> The climate here is pleasant . <&&&> You said it . Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? <&&&> Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! <&&&> What sort of pest are we dealing with ? <&&&> We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ? <&&&> That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores . <&&&> Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ? <&&&> Yes , I liked math in school . <&&&> We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ? <&&&> Yes , I enjoy working with people . <&&&> We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ? <&&&> Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ? <&&&> Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ? Will you look at this form ? <&&&> Are you having problems with it ? <&&&> I don't understand some things . Northwest Airline . <&&&> Hello , I'd like to reconfirm my flight . <&&&> May I have your flight No . , PLS ? Are you an American ? <&&&> Yeah . <&&&> Why don't you speak English ? <&&&> Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . <&&&> Oh , do you like Chinese ? <&&&> Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . <&&&> Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! <&&&> OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . <&&&> Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . <&&&> Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . <&&&> Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . <&&&> Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . <&&&> Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . <&&&> Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . <&&&> Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . Help ! I'm about to drop these books . Yes , I need more amenities . <&&&> By amenities , exactly what do you mean , please ? <&&&> You know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo . Do you have any direct flights to Toronto ? I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . <&&&> Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? <&&&> All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . <&&&> Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! <&&&> Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you . <&&&> Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . <&&&> It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . <&&&> But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? <&&&> Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? Thank you for your letter . <&&&> Is your waist any better ? <&&&> Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . <&&&> I ’ m glad you are getting better . <&&&> And I was glad to receive your letter . <&&&> Then when will you be back again ? <&&&> I will be back again next Wednesday . <&&&> I hope to see you at that time again .

Would you show us the menu ? Have you gotten a parking ticket before ? <&&&> No , I haven't . What about you ? <&&&> I got a ticket a couple of days ago . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> I got it for parking in the red zone . <&&&> Why would you park in the red zone ? <&&&> I had to run in and get something quickly . <&&&> Where were you at ? <&&&> I got the ticket in front of my apartment . Which is your preference , tea or coffee ? <&&&> My choice would always be tea . Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? <&&&> Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . <&&&> Well , Rose , <&&&> Is there something you need ? <&&&> Are your free this weekend ? <&&&> Yes , I have nothing to do . Hello , Jenny .

Mom , I'm ready for school . <&&&> Don't forger to come straight home after school . <&&&> I know , mom . Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick . <&&&> Wow , what a great burd ! How long can I keep these books ? Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? <&&&> My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . <&&&> Did you finish typing it yesterday ? <&&&> Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . <&&&> Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? <&&&> Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . <&&&> How about the shelf ? Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ? <&&&> Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner . <&&&> Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ? <&&&> It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights . <&&&> OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? <&&&> You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right . <&&&> And do I take that road ? <&&&> Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left . <&&&> Is there a Post Office sign on the building ? Are you sure you know where this bus goes ? <&&&> It should go to Altadena . <&&&> What do you mean it should ? <&&&> I'm not completely sure if it really does . <&&&> Dude , are we on the right bus ? <&&&> I'm almost positive that this is the right one . <&&&> It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena . <&&&> We have been riding this bus for a long time . <&&&> What does that sign say ? <&&&> I think it says Temple City . <&&&> Yup , I'm never trusting you with the bus schedules again . <&&&> I'm sorry . But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started . Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ? <&&&> Of course . <&&&> I'd like to change these dollars into RIB .

I mean it's too expensive a gift <&&&> you refused the gift ? That's terrible . <&&&> I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift .

It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . <&&&> Yeah . In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . <&&&> You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .

This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned . <&&&> That's OK .

What can we do ? <&&&> I don't know . <&&&> I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . <&&&> I have plenty of gas . <&&&> Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . <&&&> So what can we do ? <&&&> Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . <&&&> Alright . That's a good idea . <&&&> I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . <&&&> Days ? <&&&> Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . What is my ideal weight ? <&&&> It depends on your height and body type . How about your grades of study ? <&&&> I have been doing quite well .

What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? <&&&> I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . <&&&> Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . <&&&> Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! Who wants to go first ? Allen ? <&&&> Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet ! Have you bought your bus pass yet ? <&&&> I didn't get it yet . <&&&> Well , why not ? <&&&> I have no idea where to get it from . <&&&> You should've just asked me . <&&&> Well then , where do I get it ? <&&&> You can get it from the student business office . <&&&> I didn't know that . <&&&> I know you didn't . <&&&> I appreciate you telling me . <&&&> No problem .

What a lovely tapestry ! Don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ? <&&&> I think we can have a try . <&&&> Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style . <&&&> I see . Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . <&&&> Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . Hello .

As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . <&&&> I think of myself as a valued customer .

Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . <&&&> I'm glad to help you .

Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? <&&&> Yes , it's definitely a growing business . <&&&> What do you recycle in your plant ? <&&&> Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . <&&&> How is plastic recycled , then ? <&&&> Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand . <&&&> Me too . I like the festival best of all . <&&&> Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . <&&&> And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . <&&&> Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? <&&&> I don't think we can . <&&&> Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? <&&&> By the middle of October , I think . <&&&> That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . <&&&> I understand . <&&&> Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . <&&&> But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . <&&&> Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . <&&&> I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? <&&&> That would be terrible . <&&&> Sure thing . I have an experience like that . <&&&> Oh , how were you saved finally ? Good afternoon , Mr.Stein . I wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ? <&&&> I'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... Ah , no . I have nothing then . <&&&> Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . <&&&> How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? Mom , I want to move out . <&&&> Hey , sounds great to me , kid . What kind of job did you find ? <&&&> Job ? <&&&> Yes , job . If you ’ re going to live on your own , you have to pay for rent and everything else . what a nice uniform ! <&&&> thanks ; do you like it ? <&&&> not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? <&&&> yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . <&&&> they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? <&&&> I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . <&&&> so are you enjoying your new job ? <&&&> it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . <&&&> how do you like working in sales ? Hi , Natasha , how's life ? <&&&> Great . My family came to visit me . <&&&> Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? <&&&> My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . <&&&> I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . <&&&> I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? <&&&> Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . <&&&> Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? <&&&> The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . <&&&> Do you get along well with each other ? <&&&> Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . So , are we all behind this new project ? Would you like some drinks ? <&&&> Yes , what kinds of wine do you have ? <&&&> We have various kinds of wine . As for an appetizer , I advise you to order white wine or dry white wine . So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? <&&&> Well , I like to play the piano . <&&&> Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? <&&&> About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . <&&&> That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time . <&&&> Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? what do we need to get from the supermarket ? <&&&> we need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . <&&&> a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? <&&&> just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . <&&&> we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too . <&&&> I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ? <&&&> I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . <&&&> ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes . <&&&> we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves . <&&&> ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ? <&&&> I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . <&&&> let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything . Next , please . May I help you , sir ? <&&&> Hello , yes , I ’ d like to open a bank account . <&&&> Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ? <&&&> What features do they offer ? <&&&> Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . <&&&> I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . <&&&> Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . <&&&> No , that won ’ t be necessary . I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? <&&&> Sure . What's your room number , sir ? <&&&> It's 8736 . Here is my key card . <&&&> A minute , please . It's 6212 yuan all together . Tax included . <&&&> Can I pay with traveler's check ? <&&&> Sure . Can I have your passport , please ? <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> Thanks . Are you satisfied with your stay here with us , sir ? <&&&> Very much . The room is cozy and the service is jolly good . By the way , could you deliver my luggage to the airport in advance ? Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? <&&&> My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . <&&&> Is it really completely flat ? <&&&> Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . <&&&> Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . <&&&> The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . <&&&> That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . <&&&> There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . Is this seat taken ? Excuse me , I'm looking for your English textbooks . <&&&> They're right over there , next to the dictionaries . Do you know that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? <&&&> Really ? I ’ Ve never heard of it ! <&&&> I saw her husband have it out with her yesterday . I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . <&&&> I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable . <&&&> Would you like to get in shape together ? <&&&> What do you have in mind ? <&&&> How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . Is that Mr . Green ? <&&&> This is him speaking . <&&&> I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ? So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ? <&&&> Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! <&&&> So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? Operator , I want to make a collect overseas phone call to Beijing . <&&&> Whom would you like to talk to ? <&&&> Richard Zhang . <&&&> What is the phone number ? <&&&> The code is 880 , the area code is 010 and the local number is 8824578 4 . <&&&> Your name , please . <&&&> Monica Tang . I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! I heard that ben is forming his own band . <&&&> it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . <&&&> can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . <&&&> I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . <&&&> I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . <&&&> nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing . <&&&> I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice . I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else . <&&&> They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness . Hello , may I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to have this parcel delivered to Shanghai . <&&&> Oh , we only take care of mail . For parcels , you can go to the next window . Eric , how long will you be in China ? <&&&> I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . <&&&> Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? <&&&> Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . <&&&> Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . <&&&> You hit the nail right on the head . <&&&> Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers . <&&&> I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand . <&&&> Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? I really admire you , Diana . <&&&> why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . <&&&> you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon .

Where are you going this weekend ? I'm not satisfied with it . <&&&> Why not ? What's wrong with it ? <&&&> Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either . <&&&> Would you like another one ? Excuse me , what's your name ? <&&&> My name is Jessica . What's yours ? <&&&> John . <&&&> You speak English very well . Where should I park ? We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . <&&&> You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! <&&&> I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned . Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . <&&&> I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . <&&&> don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . <&&&> thanks for understanding . Miss , may I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . <&&&> It's because of the view . <&&&> Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? <&&&> Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . <&&&> How many elevators are there ? <&&&> There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . <&&&> How about the car-park space ? <&&&> There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . <&&&> Any other facilities ? <&&&> Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . <&&&> What is the completion date ? <&&&> The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . <&&&> How about the price and the bank mortgage ? <&&&> Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . <&&&> How many payment methods are there ? <&&&> It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . <&&&> Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . Do you play cards ? I went to the doctor yesterday . <&&&> I beg your pardon ? <&&&> I said I had been to the doctor the day before . <&&&> What did he say ? <&&&> He said I ' d got the flu . <&&&> Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? <&&&> He told me to stay in bed for ten days . <&&&> Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? Hi , what can I get for you ? <&&&> Hello , may I have a double cheeseburger ? <&&&> With everything on it ? <&&&> That sounds great . <&&&> Did you want fries with your order ? <&&&> May I get a large order of curly fries ? <&&&> Did you want something to drink ? <&&&> Get me a medium Pepsi . <&&&> Would you like anything else ? <&&&> No , thank you . That's it . I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . <&&&> But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . <&&&> However , he disappointed us very much this time . When do we get off the bus ? <&&&> I think we have a while longer . <&&&> I feel like we've been on this bus forever . <&&&> That's true . <&&&> Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already ? <&&&> I don't know . <&&&> I thought you knew where we get off at . <&&&> I wasn't really paying attention . I think we missed our stop . <&&&> Seriously ? <&&&> Yeah , we definitely missed our stop . <&&&> That's the last time I get on a bus with you . Hello , Tom ! <&&&> Hello , Steven ! <&&&> How are you doing ? <&&&> Not bad . What about you ? <&&&> I'm just a little tired . <&&&> Why ? Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? <&&&> Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . <&&&> Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . <&&&> Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . <&&&> What about the outer packing ? <&&&> We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . <&&&> Cartons ? <&&&> Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . <&&&> Could you use wooden cases instead ? <&&&> Why use wooden cases ? <&&&> I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . <&&&> The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . <&&&> Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . <&&&> No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . <&&&> Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . <&&&> Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . <&&&> Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . <&&&> But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . <&&&> If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . <&&&> I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . Did you hear how cold it got last night ? <&&&> I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . <&&&> It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . <&&&> My car didn't want to start either at first . Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? <&&&> Hello , Miao Ping . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account today . Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ? <&&&> I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much . <&&&> En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? <&&&> of course . Is the dinner still on ? <&&&> yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . <&&&> we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . <&&&> that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . <&&&> it can't be that bad . <&&&> I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . <&&&> really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . <&&&> do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . <&&&> ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? <&&&> when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . <&&&> has anything else happened to you ? <&&&> nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? <&&&> That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . <&&&> Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . <&&&> Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . <&&&> As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . <&&&> Carton ? <&&&> Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . <&&&> Could you use wooden cases instead ? <&&&> Why use wooden cases ? At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! <&&&> Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . <&&&> Do you know any secrets to China's success ? <&&&> In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? <&&&> Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . <&&&> Have you ever had any trauma ? <&&&> Yes , I have . <&&&> Does the pian become more intense at night ? <&&&> Yes , ti does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . Good morning , Mr.Jones ! <&&&> Good morning , Miss Bell ! <&&&> Nice to see you again . Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . <&&&> Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . Honey , can you set the table ? <&&&> Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? <&&&> Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . <&&&> Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? <&&&> Yeah go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . Excuse me . <&&&> Yes ? What can I help you with today ? <&&&> When does the library close ? Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park . <&&&> It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it . <&&&> It is a great place for a relaxing vacation . <&&&> Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . Hello , Mr . Brown . How are you today ? <&&&> I ’ m very well , thank you . <&&&> that ’ s good to hear . Shall we get started ? I see from your application form that you ’ Ve worked as a maintenance man for over 7 years . <&&&> yes , that ’ s true . <&&&> what kind of work did you do ? <&&&> I fixed many kinds of machine tools such as milling machines , grinders , welders , etc . I also repaired other things such as vacuums , toilets , locks , etc . I also did some electrical work . I took some courses about electrical systems . <&&&> That ’ s good . What kind of electrical work did you do ? <&&&> I took care of commercial and residential coolers and heaters . I fixed many kinds of power failure problems . Some co-workers and I even rewired part of a building . <&&&> well , your work experience sounds good for the job we have open . Now tell me about the best job you ’ Ve ever had , please . <&&&> the best job ? What do you mean ? <&&&> like the job you feel the most proud of . <&&&> I think my favorite job so far was when I worked for Linaria . It was hard work but the people on my job crew were great to work with . We really worked as a team . I enjoy working with those people . <&&&> Tell me something about a time when you did something well , something you feel proud of . <&&&> I fixed a big problem with a machine and saved a lot of money for the factory . I got bonus for it . <&&&> that ’ s great . No wonder you feel proud of that . Now let me ask you another question . <&&&> Go ahead , please . <&&&> in all the jobs you ’ Ve had , what was it you disliked the most ? <&&&> wow , this question is hard to answer . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever had a job that I really disliked . But I dislike work that is monotonous , always the same from day to day . I like to move around and do different things . <&&&> all right . Do you have any questions ? <&&&> no . I can ’ t think of any right now . <&&&> you ’ ll hear from us by the end of this week . Will you go with us this Sunday ? <&&&> What for ? Where are we going to visit today ? Where do you work ? Excuse me ? <&&&> Yes . Can I help you ? <&&&> Well , I bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . But I got the wrong size . It ’ s too small for my daughter . I wonder if I could refund it . <&&&> Yes , you could if it's kept intact . But don't you want to get a bigger size ? <&&&> I intended to , but as far as I know , all the skirts of this kind here are of the same size . There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? <&&&> Is it formal or informal ? <&&&> I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . <&&&> In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . <&&&> You are right . What about shoes ? Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ? <&&&> Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... <&&&> It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ? <&&&> I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! <&&&> Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . <&&&> Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . I ’ m so frustrated ! <&&&> what ’ s wrong , Jim ? <&&&> I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! <&&&> Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? <&&&> yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . <&&&> Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? <&&&> I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . <&&&> Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? <&&&> Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . Whoa , look at all those ice cream choices ! <&&&> Yes , that is a lot of choices . What is your favorite ? <&&&> I love anything with chocolate the best . <&&&> I like chocolate myself . <&&&> Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? This one looks great ! I love the seashore . <&&&> So do I . The sun ... the sand ... the ocean ! <&&&> And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ? <&&&> Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things . <&&&> Yeah ... me , too . Bill , please . <&&&> Please wait a moment ... here is the bill . Please check it . <&&&> Excuse me , what's this item for ? <&&&> For three bottles of Tsingtao beer . <&&&> But we've can canceled one bottle . <&&&> Oh , I'm sorry . Let me go back to the cashier's to have it changed . ( a few minutes later , the waiter returns with the new bill . ) <&&&> I'm sorry for the miscalculation . Here's the new bill . Would you mind checking it again ? Excuse me , how many sightseeing spots are there in the park ? <&&&> There are about 20 main spots and some other small spots . <&&&> Do I have to buy extra ticket if I want to visit the main spots ? Good evening , sir . Are you Mr Jim Stewart from the States ? <&&&> Ah , yes , that's right . <&&&> Glad to meet you , Mr Stewart . I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency . My name is Zhang Hua . <&&&> Hello , I was just looking for the guide . <&&&> I'm always at your service , sir . By the way , did you have a pleasant trip ? <&&&> Not bad . But I've made too many flights these days . I could hardly remember how many take-offs and landings I've been through these three days . I think we all feel a bit tired . Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? <&&&> I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . <&&&> What do you think is the biggest change ? <&&&> Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . <&&&> That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . <&&&> Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? <&&&> I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . <&&&> That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! <&&&> How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? <&&&> Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . <&&&> I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? What do you know about Julia Roberts ? <&&&> Her acting is OK . Show me the photos of the latest hair styles , will you ? Excuse me , Professor , I have a problem and need to leave class early . <&&&> Why do you have to leave early ? <&&&> I am not feeling well . <&&&> Could you make it up by attending my other section this week ? <&&&> Yes , it's all taken care of . <&&&> Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes ? Can I help you ? <&&&> I'm looking for a Sharp DVD Player . <&&&> Sure . Any particular model ? <&&&> Yes . The DS102 series . <&&&> Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular . <&&&> Will you be getting more in . I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . <&&&> That's serious . <&&&> I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . <&&&> So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . <&&&> Yes , it's an amazing drop . <&&&> Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . <&&&> Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? <&&&> Yes , and you know what ? <&&&> What ? <&&&> I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? I'm Mary Kell . May I ask your name ? <&&&> My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ? <&&&> I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . <&&&> Thank you . Miss Kelly . <&&&> What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? Sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ? <&&&> I'll have to look . What do you want it for ? <&&&> I need it for the parking meter . Can you tell me what bus to catch from Altadena to downtown LA ? <&&&> You can catch the 486 . <&&&> That bus goes all the way to LA ? <&&&> I believe so . Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled ! <&&&> Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold . <&&&> Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ? <&&&> No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something . <&&&> Whatever . Have a drink of water . <&&&> Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already . <&&&> Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit . <&&&> Do we ? Where is it ? Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . <&&&> Congratulations . That's great ! <&&&> I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . <&&&> When do you start ? <&&&> I start next Monday . <&&&> You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . <&&&> I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . <&&&> I bet . You must be stoked . <&&&> Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? <&&&> Sure . It's on you right ? Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ? <&&&> Oh , I took up a new hobby . <&&&> So you don't travel a lot now ? <&&&> No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . <&&&> It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . <&&&> Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . <&&&> Really ? That's wonderful ! <&&&> Thank you for your warning . Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ? <&&&> Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner . <&&&> Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ? <&&&> It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights . <&&&> OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? Well , what a nice day ! <&&&> Yeah , the air is really fresh . <&&&> But it was not at all so fine yesterday . <&&&> Because it rained last night . <&&&> Did it ? <&&&> It sure did . It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder . <&&&> I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing . <&&&> Well , it may rain again later today . <&&&> Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in . <&&&> There may also be a strong wind coming in . <&&&> It'll be dusty , too , I guess . <&&&> Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . <&&&> Why is that ? <&&&> We've been planting trees for many years . <&&&> I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . <&&&> But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . OK.sir . Your room is done . Is there anything else I can do for you ? <&&&> Would you please help me send these clothes to the laundry ? <&&&> OK.sir . This is Mary .

I don't know , but he gives me the creeps . <&&&> Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security . <&&&> But what if he knows my name , where I live ... <&&&> Don't get all worked up over him . He's probably harmless . <&&&> Actually , he's really good-looking . Too bad he's a weirdo . <&&&> You never know . Maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy ... You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . <&&&> I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . <&&&> That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . <&&&> Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . <&&&> And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? Bonjour ! <&&&> What ? <&&&> I said , Bonjour ! <&&&> What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ? <&&&> I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ? <&&&> What ’ s wrong with speaking English ? <&&&> Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed ! Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time .

In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ? Can you work over tonight ?

And here's your receipt , sir . <&&&> Many thanks . <&&&> I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir . <&&&> This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great . People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . <&&&> And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? <&&&> Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . <&&&> Then what are the Westerners fit for ? My stomach's growling again ! <&&&> You'll never lose weight if you listen to your stomach . <&&&> Just a little steak , uh ... snack ? A bowl of clam chowder ? <&&&> You want to be beautiful , don't you ? Think about the butter and flour in ... Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . <&&&> I'm glad you came .

Have any trouble finding the place ? <&&&> No problem . <&&&> So why don ’ t you tell me why you are interested in changing positions ? <&&&> Unfortunately , our company is shutting down due to the economy . I need to get internet . <&&&> Which kind of internet connection do you want to get ? <&&&> What kind can I get ? <&&&> There is dial-up or DEL . <&&&> Which one do you feel is best ? <&&&> I would get DEL if I were you . Are you a good driver ? <&&&> Yes , I'm rather good at driving . <&&&> I need you to teach me how to drive . <&&&> Yes , but do you have your learner's permit ? <&&&> Yes , I have it . <&&&> Have you ever driven a car before ? <&&&> I drove a car before , but only once . <&&&> Are you aware of all the controls in the car ?

This apartment is great , but could I upgrade a few things ? <&&&> What are you unhappy with ? <&&&> I want to have a different color carpet . <&&&> If you agree to pay more money , you could upgrade the carpet . <&&&> Would it cost a lot more ? <&&&> It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard . <&&&> I was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color . I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? Hello , May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . <&&&> Oh , how nice ! There are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! <&&&> Hi , Alex ! <&&&> Where have you been ? <&&&> I just got back from London . <&&&> How was your flight ? <&&&> It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . <&&&> That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? <&&&> It was 10 hours . <&&&> Did you have a layover ? <&&&> Yes , in Paris , France . <&&&> Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? <&&&> You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . <&&&> What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . <&&&> Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? <&&&> I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . <&&&> I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . <&&&> Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? <&&&> Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . <&&&> Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? <&&&> Right here . May I help you ? <&&&> I would like to return this book . <&&&> May I do anything else for you ? <&&&> I would also like to check out these books . <&&&> Will that be all ? <&&&> That ’ s it . <&&&> Do you have your library card ? <&&&> Oh , yeah . Here you go . <&&&> Will that be all for today ? <&&&> That ’ ll be all . You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . <&&&> Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . Why are those people crying ? <&&&> They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day . <&&&> Tomb Sweeping Day ? What is it ? <&&&> Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead . <&&&> What do they do ? I'd like to pay my bill now . <&&&> Your name and room number , please ? <&&&> Tom Wilson in Room 306 . <&&&> Have you used any hotel services this morning ? ... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . <&&&> With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . <&&&> Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! <&&&> This one ? <&&&> That ’ s my index finger ! <&&&> Oh , right . This one , right ? <&&&> Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . <&&&> Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! I want to buy some jewellery . <&&&> What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? <&&&> I should like to look at some bracelets . <&&&> May I show you gold ones or platinum ones ? My name is Mary , and I will be your server this evening . <&&&> Hi Mary . We are really looking forward to a great meal here . <&&&> Can I interest you in an appetizer to start out ? <&&&> I would love an appetizer . Are they listed in the menu ? <&&&> We have our daily appetizers listed on the board over there on the wall . <&&&> I am thinking about the popcorn shrimp . How is that ? When do you go to bed usually ? <&&&> I go to bed at ten and get up at six . What's wrong with you ? <&&&> My head hurts badly . <&&&> How long has it been like this ? <&&&> Since last night . How is your business on the Internet , Steven ? <&&&> Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . <&&&> I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas . <&&&> I changed my strategy around too . I am investing in good companies now . <&&&> Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . Can I help you ? <&&&> Wait a minute , please . <&&&> Have you made a reservation ? <&&&> No , I'd like to book a single room with one double bed . <&&&> How long will you be staying ? <&&&> 2 nights , how much does it cost ? <&&&> A single room costs you $ 85 / day . <&&&> Does the charge include everything ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Do you require a deposit ? Where do we get off at ? <&&&> I think we have a little ways to go . What do you consider to be your strong points ? <&&&> I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . <&&&> Why do you say that ? <&&&> I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . <&&&> Really ? Are you still playing ? <&&&> Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . <&&&> I see . You must be tough . <&&&> I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . <&&&> What do you consider to be your weak points ? <&&&> Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . <&&&> What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? <&&&> So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . How is your English ability ? <&&&> Not bad .

So I can say anything I want . <&&&> Do you believe what they say ? Can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ? Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? Do you have anything to wash ?

Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . <&&&> Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? <&&&> Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English .

This is a wonderful job for the right person , regular hours , no night shifts , no supervisor behind you , and good pay . Thanks for lunch . It was delicious . Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . I was really glad to hear about your promotion . Congratulations ! Tom , how do you think of second-hand goods ? <&&&> Why did you ask that ? Do you want to buy the used goods ? <&&&> I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now . <&&&> You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap . <&&&> But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ?

Your watch is fast . How about a movie tonight ? <&&&> It doesn't matter to me . <&&&> Does 7 o'clock suit you ? <&&&> Either way . I don't care . <&&&> How about a snack after work ? <&&&> I couldn't careless . Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? Are things still going badly with your house guest ? <&&&> It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . <&&&> leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . <&&&> Great . Where is it ? <&&&> A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . <&&&> What about the surrounding area ? How many rooms are you looking for ? <&&&> Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ? <&&&> 150 a month . What kind of music do you like listening to ? <&&&> I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing . <&&&> Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? <&&&> You can say that again ! <&&&> What's up with Vince and Elvin ? <&&&> They work for Zina now . <&&&> And they're happy with that ? Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . <&&&> Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . <&&&> Show me some classic high heels , please . <&&&> Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? <&&&> Black . Classic . <&&&> Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . <&&&> Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . <&&&> OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . <&&&> I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for . Who's that over here ? Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ? <&&&> What ? Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? <&&&> Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . <&&&> Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? <&&&> No , it's just a couple of minutes . My brother gave me a baby cat yesterday . I can keep it as my pet . <&&&> I don ’ t understand . Why do you want a cat ? What do you think of this coffee table ? <&&&> It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room . <&&&> How about this one ? <&&&> Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean . <&&&> Alright , let's look at some others . who is your favorite NBA star ? <&&&> Kobe Bryant , of course . <&&&> Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . <&&&> He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . <&&&> Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? <&&&> indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . <&&&> Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? So what's wrong with the drain ? <&&&> It's clogged and water won't go down . <&&&> Let me take a look . You know why ? It's clogged with hair . No wonder water won't go down . Can I help you ? <&&&> I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? <&&&> Yes , they all stop at this corner . <&&&> I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street.Can I take any bus that comes along ? <&&&> You can take any bus except the Number 9 . <&&&> How often do the buses run ? <&&&> They run about every five minutes . <&&&> Fine.How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? <&&&> About fifteen minutes.It ' s not far.Are you a stranger in New York ? <&&&> Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . <&&&> How do you like New York city ? <&&&> I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . <&&&> Yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ? <&&&> Seriously . The only tax I don't mind them taking is social security . It's only a few dollars every paycheck . <&&&> Yeah , I don't mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? <&&&> Yeah . It won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . <&&&> Yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . <&&&> Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it . what date is it today ? <&&&> why ? <&&&> look at the girls in the street . They all have bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? <&&&> Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . <&&&> did you have a fight with Jack ? <&&&> no , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? <&&&> come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . <&&&> you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . <&&&> is that your phone ? <&&&> oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . <&&&> wow ! good timing . <&&&> he asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? <&&&> come on ! three's a crowd ! What can I do for you today ? <&&&> It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note . <&&&> Do you remember where you got it ? <&&&> No , I don't . Usually I'm very careful about checking the money I'm given , but for some reason this one slipped through . It's really late but I'm starving . <&&&> Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . <&&&> Maybe they have some good pie . <&&&> I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . <&&&> There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . <&&&> Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . What are you doing tonight ? <&&&> I have to run to the grocery store . <&&&> Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? <&&&> Yes , but I am out of food and milk . <&&&> What store do you shop at ? <&&&> The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . <&&&> I have been using the store across town for years . <&&&> I hear they have very nice stuff . <&&&> They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . I can ’ t wait to retire . Excuse me , could you please take a picture for us ? Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . <&&&> is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? <&&&> yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . I need to open an account . <&&&> Do you know what kind you want to open ? <&&&> I want a checking account . <&&&> Do you know what the minimum balance is ? <&&&> What is that ? <&&&> You need to keep it at $ 100 . Please show me the menu , Miss . <&&&> Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . <&&&> All right . Can I serve you anything else ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please . Put all baggage on the conveyor belt.Walk through the detector gate one at a time , please . <&&&> Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ? <&&&> What for ? Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! <&&&> Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? <&&&> Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . <&&&> Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? <&&&> Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? <&&&> Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . <&&&> That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . <&&&> Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . <&&&> That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? <&&&> Definitely pre-med . What about you ? I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . <&&&> May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? <&&&> You see , there is a run at the neck . <&&&> Oh , sorry.But do you want to change it for another one ? That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? <&&&> Of course . I always keep what I catch . <&&&> Not me . I like to throw back what I catch . Would you mind telling me the purpose of your visit to the U . K . ? <&&&> I am here on business . <&&&> May I see your passport ? <&&&> Of course , here you are . <&&&> Would you please open the suitcase ? What are these ? <&&&> They are two cameras . <&&&> Do you have anything to declare ? There isn't much rice , is there ? <&&&> No , there isn't , but there are some vegetables . <&&&> Are there any potatoes ? <&&&> No , there aren't . I'm sorry . <&&&> I'm very hungry , Donald . What can I eat ? <&&&> There's a little bread and there are a few biscuits . <&&&> But I want some rice and some meat . <&&&> All right , I'll walk to the village and I'll get some meat . <&&&> Good . By the way , who's going to cook the meat ? How are you doing today ? <&&&> I ’ m fine . <&&&> What can I do for you ? <&&&> I would like to cancel a check . <&&&> Is there a problem ? <&&&> I wrote the check out for too much . <&&&> How much did you write it out for ? <&&&> I wrote it out for $ 150 . <&&&> How much was it supposed to be ? Good morning , Mr Croft . <&&&> Good morning , nurse . I want to see the dentist , please . <&&&> Do you have an appointment ? <&&&> No , I don't . <&&&> Is it urgent ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It's very urgent . I feel awful . I have a terrible toothache . <&&&> Can you come at 10 am on Monday , April 24th ? Susan , good evening.Why are you so dressed up ? <&&&> I'm on my way out to a New Year's banquet.How do I look ? Is my make-up ok ? <&&&> You look great.Your make-up is perfect . <&&&> Do your think I should wear a different dress ? I need a room for a few days . <&&&> That won't be a problem . Could you please tell me your name ? <&&&> John Sandals . That's S A N D A L S . <&&&> Sir , I'm Michelle , and I run the front desk . Please tell me the days you'll be here . <&&&> I'll be there in April Friday through Monday , the 14th through the 17th . <&&&> We recently changed many things here , sir , including our prices . Do you mind , sir ? <&&&> Possibly . What's the actual price ? <&&&> The price will be $ 308 a night . <&&&> $ 308 ! That's not bad . <&&&> Very good . Now , Mr . Sandals , about the room , smoking or nonsmoking ? <&&&> Nonsmoking , definitely ! Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . <&&&> There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . <&&&> I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . <&&&> Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . <&&&> When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? <&&&> Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . <&&&> When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things . <&&&> That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . <&&&> That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time <&&&> How do I do that ? What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! Did you like the play ? <&&&> Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . <&&&> You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . <&&&> Very well . We have some fresh red roses . <&&&> How much are the roses ? <&&&> $ 20 per dozen . <&&&> That sounds like a good deal . <&&&> Yes , they're on sale today . Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> I want to have a haircut . <&&&> Please take a seat . Do you need a shampoo ? <&&&> How much is a regular haircut without shampoo ? <&&&> $ 10 . <&&&> And how much for haircut with shampoo ? Brian , a company called me for an interview . <&&&> That's great ! You need to prepare for it . <&&&> How ? <&&&> Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . <&&&> Okay . <&&&> Buy an expensive suit . <&&&> How expensive ? <&&&> The more expensive , the better . <&&&> I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? <&&&> That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . <&&&> How ? <&&&> If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine . <&&&> Is a white blouse okay ? <&&&> Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . <&&&> Black ? <&&&> Black is good . <&&&> White pantyhose ? <&&&> No . Dark or skin colored . <&&&> Jewelry ? <&&&> Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . <&&&> How about make up ? <&&&> Not much make up . <&&&> Perfume ? Are you going out again ? <&&&> Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . <&&&> You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . <&&&> Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? <&&&> No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . <&&&> Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . Peter , listen to the lyrics of this song . Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . <&&&> Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too . <&&&> I guess we'll see each other around . <&&&> Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy . As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? <&&&> That's right . Here you go . <&&&> Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... <&&&> OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . <&&&> You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . <&&&> That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water . <&&&> I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . <&&&> Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has . <&&&> OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? Excuse me . My bag was stolen , will you help me ? <&&&> When did it happen ? <&&&> Just about half an hour ago . <&&&> Tell me where it happened and how . <&&&> Yes , it was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper . do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? <&&&> sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? <&&&> I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . <&&&> that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? <&&&> I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . <&&&> if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? <&&&> I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue . Would you like to have a piece of cake ? <&&&> No , thank you . I'm on a diet . hello ? <&&&> good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . <&&&> good morning . <&&&> the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . <&&&> oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . <&&&> she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . <&&&> is there someone else I can talk to ? <&&&> she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? <&&&> any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . <&&&> Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do . I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank . <&&&> That's no problem at all , but could you fill in this and I'll need to see some ID . <&&&> Here you go . Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in ? <&&&> Yes , there needs to be at least 1 RIB paid in to open a new account . Also , you will need to choose a secret identity code to ensure no one else can enter your account . I think you are an excellent person . Honestly speaking , you are very suitable for this job <&&&> Thank you very much for your evaluation . I also like this job very much . <&&&> I want to know your earliest available entry time . <&&&> Oh , let me think ... Maybe two months later . <&&&> It's too late . If you could get the job , could you start a little earlier ? <&&&> I'm sorry I can't , because I haven't finished my thesis . <&&&> What a pity ! <&&&> When do you usually require the new employee to start ? How is the college search going ? <&&&> It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . <&&&> But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? What a brilliant smile ! <&&&> That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling . <&&&> He must be very easy-going . Good afternoon , how can I help you ? Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . <&&&> Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? <&&&> Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? <&&&> Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs . <&&&> That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . Does it look too big ? <&&&> It looks like it was made just for you . Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? <&&&> I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days . <&&&> No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package . <&&&> That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time . <&&&> OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days . <&&&> I see . How much do I need to pay in total for this package ? <&&&> It's 500 dollars . <&&&> Can I have the receipt ? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong . What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . <&&&> This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . <&&&> I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . <&&&> Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! <&&&> Can I read it when you're finished ? <&&&> Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . <&&&> Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? <&&&> Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . <&&&> Oh ... why ? <&&&> Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . <&&&> Sure . What is it ? Hello . <&&&> Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ? <&&&> Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? <&&&> Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals . <&&&> What's the difference between the two ? <&&&> If you open a fixed account , the interest rate is higher . You look so excited . What happened ? I need to get internet . <&&&> Which kind of internet connection do you want to get ? <&&&> What kind can I get ? <&&&> There is dial-up or DEL . <&&&> Which one do you feel is best ? <&&&> I would get DEL if I were you . <&&&> DEL is better than dial-up ? <&&&> It's the best choice ; plus , it won't tie up your phone line . <&&&> I'm not sure what that means . <&&&> Dial-up is connected through your phone , unlike DEL . Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? <&&&> No , nobody . <&&&> You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? Hello . <&&&> Hi . <&&&> How are you ? Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class . <&&&> Is this something that you could schedule for another time ? Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? <&&&> Yes , here you go . <&&&> Will you be checking any bags today . Do you often do exercise ? <&&&> Certainly . <&&&> OK , and what kind of sports do you usually play ? <&&&> I often play badminton with my parents . <&&&> You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket . <&&&> Hey , I'm good at playing it . <&&&> Says who ? <&&&> My parents . <&&&> Oh , I see . Are you ready to order , sir ? <&&&> What's the special here ? <&&&> We have steamed chicken , braised pork and Beijing roast duck and so on . Here's the menu . What would you like to have ? <&&&> Well , let's try some braised pork , sweet and sour fish and some fried beans . <&&&> Would you like anything to drink ? Bye , mom ! <&&&> Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on ! Do you buy that newspaper every day ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I find it very informative . It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . <&&&> Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? <&&&> Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . <&&&> What section does it have ? Hi !

How's her headspace ? <&&&> She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . <&&&> I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . <&&&> Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? <&&&> No , why ? <&&&> My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . What's the matter , sir ? You look pale . <&&&> I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . <&&&> Are you often traveling by plane ? <&&&> No , this is the second time . <&&&> That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . <&&&> Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad . <&&&> Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . <&&&> What should I do about it ? <&&&> You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts . <&&&> OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . <&&&> Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? <&&&> Much better . Thank you .

My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people . <&&&> Wow , like how do they train the dogs ? <&&&> How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school . <&&&> Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ? <&&&> Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training . <&&&> Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ? <&&&> Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile .

I was told that your company had been in the furniture industry for many years . What kinds of products do you generally handle ? <&&&> We mostly handle office furniture . We supply first-class furniture . Here are our catalogue and the pattern books . You can see the material is superior and with all the latest styles . Can you give me some idea about what you're looking for ? <&&&> You know , we want to totally furnish our new office building . This is a list of what we need . Could you give me a ballpark figure for everything on this list ? May I order some cable from you today ? <&&&> Okay , what package would you like to order ? <&&&> I'm not sure of what packages you offer . I am starving . <&&&> Let's go get something to eat . <&&&> Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ? <&&&> We can always go to the cafeteria and eat . <&&&> I haven't eaten there before . <&&&> The food there is pretty good . <&&&> What kind of food do they serve ? Hello ! How can I help you , sir ? <&&&> I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? <&&&> Do you qualify for any of the Federal loan programs ? <&&&> Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . <&&&> Well . In that case we can offer you a private educational loan . <&&&> What's the interest rate ? What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? <&&&> Coffee , please . <&&&> So , you also like Coffee ? <&&&> Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . <&&&> Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . <&&&> I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . Northward Airways , good morning . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon ? <&&&> One moment , please ... Yes . There's a flight at 16:45 and one at 18:00 . <&&&> That's fine . Could you tell me how much a return flight costs ? I'll be staying three weeks . We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . <&&&> I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . <&&&> Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? <&&&> Why not ? I'd love to do that . <&&&> Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) <&&&> Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? <&&&> Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? <&&&> I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . <&&&> No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . <&&&> Unbelievable ! I could never do that . I'd like to request some more amenities . <&&&> Amenities ? What do you mean by amenities , sir ? <&&&> Well , the free stuff ! You know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc . <&&&> I see . Sir , if I may ask . Have you used up all the amenities in your room ? <&&&> Not at all . I still have enough for the next few days . <&&&> Then what is the problem , sir ? <&&&> I need some to keep as souvenirs ! David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? <&&&> Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . <&&&> But they can see my resume . It's all in there . Where is your dressing room ? <&&&> Right over there . <&&&> ( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ? <&&&> I loved it . I'll take it . <&&&> Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 . Good morning . <&&&> Morning . What would you like for breakfast ? <&&&> I'm not quite hungry now . Let me think for a while . <&&&> Come on . We are going to be late . You ’ Ve been a sales manager for three years . How do you like the job ? I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can't find a cheap plane ticket . <&&&> Have you tried the Internet ? Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? <&&&> My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . <&&&> That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . <&&&> Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? <&&&> What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . <&&&> Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? How can we avoid the jam ? Good morning , sir . Welcome to Flower Hotel . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> How many pieces of baggage do you have ? Your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair . <&&&> Would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . <&&&> This is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . <&&&> Cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? <&&&> Ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? <&&&> Sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . <&&&> That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? <&&&> That's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . <&&&> Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . <&&&> You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? <&&&> I don't think it's broken . Good morning . My name is Penny White . I'm new here . <&&&> Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . <&&&> OK . Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? <&&&> Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes . <&&&> That doesn't sound too bad . <&&&> Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . May I take your drink order while you are looking over your menu ? <&&&> Yes , do you have a wine list ? <&&&> The wine list is on the second page of your menu . <&&&> Do you have mixed drinks in this restaurant ? Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? <&&&> Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . <&&&> I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? Tell me about yourself and your past experience . <&&&> For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member . <&&&> Why are you interested in this occupation ? <&&&> It's always been my dream to be a stewardess . And I like travelling to different places . What's wrong with you ? Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? <&&&> Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . <&&&> Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? <&&&> Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! <&&&> I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . <&&&> Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? <&&&> Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . <&&&> Cool ! Teach me ! It's late.It ' s high time I left.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . <&&&> Don't mention it . Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? <&&&> Sure , what's up ? <&&&> I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? <&&&> Good question . I have to think about it . <&&&> My husband is betting on France . how is your house hunting going ? <&&&> not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . <&&&> how much are you looking to spend ? <&&&> I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . <&&&> looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . <&&&> really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . <&&&> well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! <&&&> do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? <&&&> I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? So , Emily , how was your day ? <&&&> I don't think you really want to hear about it . <&&&> It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . <&&&> To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! <&&&> Why ? What happened ? How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? <&&&> Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . <&&&> Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? <&&&> I like taking photos out of doors . <&&&> Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . <&&&> Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . How do you like the apartment ? <&&&> I like the apartment , but I see something wrong with it . <&&&> What ’ s wrong ? <&&&> There ’ s a leaking faucet in the sink . <&&&> That isn ’ t a problem . <&&&> That leak is going to raise my water bill . <&&&> What can I do ? <&&&> You need to fix it . <&&&> I can ’ t right now . Personnel . May I help you ? The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . <&&&> Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? <&&&> Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . <&&&> What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? <&&&> Autumn is also very nice In Washington . <&&&> Is it very cold in winter there ? <&&&> No . it isn ’ t . But sometimes it slows a lot in winter . <&&&> Does it rain a lot in summer there ? <&&&> Oh . Yes . Sometimes it rains very heavily I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . <&&&> but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . <&&&> I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . <&&&> it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . <&&&> you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . <&&&> it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . <&&&> yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . <&&&> that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry . Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all . <&&&> Of course.Don ' t worry . I'll call one for you . <&&&> Thank you very much , by the way , is it quite expensive to take a taxi ? <&&&> Yes , besides it versa according to the distance . I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . <&&&> We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . <&&&> I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . <&&&> We need to find a good realtor . <&&&> Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . <&&&> But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . <&&&> Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . <&&&> I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems . So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . <&&&> And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? <&&&> Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . <&&&> I ’ Ve heard this one before . <&&&> But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! <&&&> Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . Switchboard . Which extension would you like ? There is a problem in my apartment . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> A pipe broke in my wall , and water is leaking . <&&&> Is the water causing any damage ? <&&&> Yes , it ’ s creating mildew on the walls . <&&&> I won ’ t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow . <&&&> I can call a plumber to fix it right now . <&&&> I ’ ll do it for you . <&&&> Well , you can ’ t do it until tomorrow , and I need it fixed now . <&&&> That ’ s true . What sort of experience do you have ? Maybe you should talk to the teacher . Did you working in a similar position before ? <&&&> Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . <&&&> Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ? <&&&> Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . <&&&> If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? <&&&> I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . <&&&> Are you able to operate the telex ? <&&&> Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . You look pale , you must have poor health . Hi . How can I help you ? <&&&> I ’ m looking for a job . Are you hiring ? <&&&> Yes , we are . What position are you looking for ? <&&&> Superintendent . <&&&> I ’ m sorry . The application for this position has closed . <&&&> Do you have any other positions available ? <&&&> We have only one position open . <&&&> What is it ? Excuse me Miss , my friend is sick . <&&&> Is he ? Yes . He looks pale , is there anything I can do for him ? <&&&> Yes , please give him some water . <&&&> Certainly . Excuse me , sir . May I go with you to claim my luggage ? I am a stranger here . <&&&> Sure , I have to go anyway . But the first place you need to go is immigration office . They ’ ll check your ticket , passport , visa and immunization record book . After that we can go to the baggage claim area . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> This is my luggage , but it's too heavy . I can't move it . Could you help me get it out of the conveyer belt ? <&&&> Certainly , it's a pleasure . <&&&> Where shall we go next ? <&&&> Customs . <&&&> Ok . <&&&> Do you have anything to declare ? <&&&> No , I don't . <&&&> Would you like to open the suitcase , please ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> What's in the box ? <&&&> Chocolates . <&&&> Are they liqueur chocolates ? <&&&> No , they are peppermint chocolates . <&&&> How many cigarettes do you have ? May I help you ? <&&&> I would like to return this book . <&&&> May I do anything else for you ? <&&&> I would also like to check out these books . <&&&> Will that be all ? How's your new car ? <&&&> Perfect.Couldn ' t be better ! <&&&> You made a good choice , then ? <&&&> It's just what I wanted . <&&&> No regrets ? <&&&> I'm really pleased with it.Thanks . <&&&> I'm glad you're so happy . How was Mei ’ s party on Saturday ? <&&&> Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family . <&&&> Oh really ? What did you do ? <&&&> We watched lots of television and films . <&&&> I see . Anything else ? Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? <&&&> I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . <&&&> How would you solve the problem ? <&&&> I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . <&&&> It would probably be very expensive . <&&&> I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . <&&&> It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . <&&&> If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . I'm exhausted . Employees in this company have to have a good command of English . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? <&&&> I don't know . Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? Good . There is the information desk . How do we get to seventieth street , please ? <&&&> The northern line is what you want . <&&&> How much is it ? How can I help you ? Mr . Smith , this is your schedule . <&&&> OK . Let me see . Are you a visitor here ? All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water . <&&&> Let's line up here . This line seems a little shorter . <&&&> What's on the menu today ? <&&&> Fish , beef , pork , chicken , vegetables and beancurd . For staple food we have rice , steamed bread , stuffed buns and noodles . <&&&> Oh , we're lucky today , aren't we ? <&&&> I'd rather take stewed cabbage with beef . <&&&> I think I'll take fried fish , because fish is one of my favorites . <&&&> That's good , we can share what we have . Here we are . You go ahead . <&&&> ( They get everything ready ) Here is a free table . Let's sit down . Help yourself to some fish please . Isn't it delicious and appetizing ? <&&&> I'm sorry I don't like it's a little too salty . <&&&> I see . You people from south prefer sweet , don't you ? What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ? <&&&> What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . <&&&> Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . <&&&> Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ? How come it is slow as a snail today ? <&&&> You mean the network connection ? <&&&> Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? <&&&> Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! <&&&> Let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? <&&&> What would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? <&&&> I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time . <&&&> Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? <&&&> Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? <&&&> Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . Would you please teach me how to use the computer ? <&&&> Sure , let's take a look at the menu first . Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? <&&&> It's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . <&&&> Cindy , you're so cute . <&&&> She is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? <&&&> I have a little white cat . <&&&> Oh , a cat ? Come on . <&&&> Yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . <&&&> But I think they're dull , aren't they ? <&&&> Not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . <&&&> You moved to a new place ? <&&&> Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . <&&&> Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? <&&&> It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance . <&&&> Who else will come ? <&&&> I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him . Hi , may I get you anything to drink ? <&&&> Yes , please . May I get a glass of lemonade ? <&&&> Would you like an appetizer ? How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? <&&&> No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . <&&&> I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . <&&&> Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . <&&&> I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . <&&&> I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . <&&&> It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? <&&&> To be honest , I wouldn't . <&&&> Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? <&&&> Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . <&&&> What's the puzzle ? <&&&> My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . <&&&> Oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . <&&&> Yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . <&&&> Oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . <&&&> But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . <&&&> Definitely . What did you think of the movie ? <&&&> I didn't like it . Not a bit . I couldn't stand the music . Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep . <&&&> I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz . <&&&> I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie . <&&&> I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ? <&&&> Anything with a lot of action , I like thrillers and chillers . Hello , I want to order an Easy-own package . What would you recommend ? <&&&> Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ? Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . <&&&> Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . <&&&> Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . <&&&> Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . <&&&> You've had a good trip , I hope . <&&&> Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . <&&&> It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . <&&&> So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . <&&&> We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . <&&&> I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . <&&&> Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . <&&&> That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? Hi , I was wondering if I could get my test results from the other day . <&&&> Yes , I would like to schedule an appointment for you to come in and talk with me . <&&&> Is something wrong with me ? <&&&> No , sometimes the test results aren ’ t clear and we need to do more to get a clearer picture . <&&&> Can we talk about it now ? <&&&> I would if I knew anything for sure , but I want to take a second look . <&&&> When can I come and see you ? <&&&> You can come in this afternoon . If you would feel better , bring your husband with you . <&&&> Now I know that something bad is up ! Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card . <&&&> Sure , let me give you an application . You can fill it out right here at the counter . <&&&> OK , here it is . <&&&> Let me take a look at this for you . May I have your driver's license , please ? <&&&> Here's my license and form . <&&&> You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ? <&&&> Yes , I know what to do . <&&&> The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout . Well , Peter . I'm sorry you're ill . What's the matter with you ? <&&&> I don't know , Doctor . I'm ill . I have a headache and a stomachache . <&&&> Show me your torgue.What did you eat yesterday ? <&&&> Well , Doctor , I . . . <&&&> Did you eat any cake ? <&&&> Yes , I ate some cake . It's taking you forever to do my hair . <&&&> Give me a minute . <&&&> You should've been done already . <&&&> There you go . <&&&> I don't think that you're done . <&&&> What's wrong ? I ’ m so frustrated ! <&&&> what ’ s wrong , Jim ? I am really interested in buying this television . <&&&> That's great ! <&&&> How much are you selling it for ? <&&&> This TV is $ 2500 . <&&&> You can't be serious . <&&&> That's how much this t . v costs . <&&&> That's too expensive for me . <&&&> This television is of very high quality . <&&&> You can't go down on the price ? <&&&> By how much ? <&&&> I'll buy it for $ 2000 . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . What's today's rate of US dollar against the RIB yuan ? <&&&> Let me see , the buying rate is RIB 808 per $ 100 . How much would you like to change ? <&&&> $ 200 altogether . <&&&> Would you mind showing me your passport ? <&&&> Here it is . And how much RIB shall I get ? Good morning madam . What can I get you ? <&&&> I ’ d like a coffee please . <&&&> Certainly madam , what kind of coffee would you like ? <&&&> What have you got ? <&&&> Well we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte or Americano . Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? <&&&> Yes , they all stop at this corner . <&&&> I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ? <&&&> You can take any bus except the Number 9 . <&&&> How often do the buses run ? <&&&> They run about every five minutes . <&&&> Fine . How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? <&&&> About fifteen minutes . It's not far . Are you a stranger in New York ? <&&&> Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . I'm phoning about the factory visit next Friday . What should I do when I arrive ? You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . <&&&> Where did you get that idea ? <&&&> That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . <&&&> Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . <&&&> Is it true or isn ’ t it ? <&&&> Do you want to know something about the American character ? <&&&> I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . <&&&> No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . <&&&> OK , go on . Hi , Mike . We're having a party tonight , wanna come join us ? You can bring your girlfriend . <&&&> Well . I am breaking up with Cathy . <&&&> What happened ? Did you have a fight ? <&&&> No . She is really a very nice girl ... <&&&> Yeah , she is . She is pretty , caring , getting easy-going and she is a great cook . She is a gem . When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? <&&&> I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? <&&&> I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . <&&&> That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . <&&&> That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? <&&&> Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . <&&&> Did you ? How is he these days ? Did you bring some lunch with you ? <&&&> Yes , I packed it myself . <&&&> Wow , that looks beautiful . What do you want to eat today ? <&&&> I feel like having some dumplings . Let's go out to eat . <&&&> No need ! I know how to make dumplings . Let's do it from scratch . Can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? I don't think I can finish everything by myself . I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . <&&&> We have some fresh red roses . <&&&> How much are the roses ? <&&&> Twenty dollars per dozen . <&&&> That sounds like a good deal . <&&&> Yes , that is today's sale price . <&&&> I'll take a dozen . <&&&> Is there anything else you'd like to get ? <&&&> No , the roses will be fine . Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . <&&&> You moved to a new place ? <&&&> Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home .

Just ask the guard at the entrance . <&&&> Who else will come ? <&&&> I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him . <&&&> Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ? Would you like to see our new shirts ? <&&&> Sorry , I'm not really that interested in those things . <&&&> They are very nice , you know . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> And not expensive either . <&&&> Oh . I don't care about that . <&&&> Everybody's buying them . I like football best of all . <&&&> Do you ? <&&&> It's a very good game . <&&&> Do you watch it or do you still play it ? Excuse me , sir . Can I help you ? <&&&> I'd be glad to have your help . Could you make the air-conditioner cooler ? <&&&> I'm sorry . We can not regulate the air-conditioner . As soon as the plane takes off we'll be able to get better ventilation , and the temperature here will drop . Let me get a wet towel for you at the moment . <&&&> Good idea . <&&&> Your wet towel , sir . <&&&> Thank you . Could I have something cold to drink ? <&&&> Yes .

I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . <&&&> is it a horror movie ? <&&&> yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? <&&&> no way . I will be scared out of my wits . <&&&> that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . <&&&> Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? <&&&> alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? <&&&> Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . <&&&> that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? <&&&> Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time . <&&&> Are all of your team members on schedule ? <&&&> A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems . <&&&> How have they decided to deal with that ? <&&&> They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend . <&&&> That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ? <&&&> We agreed that the deadline was next Friday . <&&&> Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . Doctor , what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be ? Oh . Have you finished listing your study preferences ? <&&&> Yes , I have . <&&&> Good .

Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . <&&&> I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan . <&&&> It's different in my case .

It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ? <&&&> Yes . He told me to come by this morning . <&&&> I'm sorry , but he's not in the office now . Do you have an appointment ? <&&&> An appointment ? <&&&> Yes . What time did he expect you ? <&&&> He said I should come by this morning . He didn't give me a time.He said I could come any time before noon . <&&&> I see . He's usually here on Tuesday mornings ... <&&&> Today is Tuesday . <&&&> I know . He's usually here , but today he went out to a site on the east side . <&&&> That's too bad . I need to discuss these plans with him . <&&&> Why don't you make an appointment for later in the week ? <&&&> Alright . <&&&> He's here on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays . What day did you want to see him ? <&&&> Friday is good . <&&&> Morning or afternoon ? <&&&> Morning . <&&&> I can put you down for ten o'clock . Is that alright ? <&&&> Yes . My name is Laura Wills . <&&&> Alright . I have you down for ten AM this Friday . <&&&> Thank you . I have a taste for something sweet . <&&&> What are you thinking ? <&&&> I want some kind of dessert . Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch . They have good cheese burgers . <&&&> OK . I am hungry , too . I like their milkshake . They're very creamy and tasty . <&&&> Look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . It must be very delicious . <&&&> Yup . But , this also means we have to wait to order our food . <&&&> Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it . <&&&> Well , sounds very attractive . I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious . <&&&> Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it . <&&&> OK , I think I know what to order for my lunch now . But , eating too much fried food really makes me fat . <&&&> Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you . <&&&> That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ? Do you know what time it is ? <&&&> Um . Ten ? <&&&> Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew . <&&&> I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party ! Good afternoon . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to check in . <&&&> Do you have a reservation ? <&&&> Yes , my name is Steven Smith . I have a reservation from October 2nd to October 6th . I called last week . <&&&> Wait a moment , please . Oh , yes , Steven Smith . It's for a single room with a bath . Is that right ? <&&&> Yes , that's right . <&&&> Now , Mr . Smith , could you fill out this registration form , please ? Good morning ! What's wrong with you ? <&&&> I have a bad headache . <&&&> How long have you been like this ? <&&&> For two days . <&&&> Do you have a fever ? <&&&> I ’ m afraid so . Sometimes I feel hot and sometimes I feel cold . Is there a city where it's always warm ? <&&&> Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . <&&&> Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? <&&&> Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . <&&&> But why do so many people live there ? <&&&> Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . <&&&> Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? <&&&> Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . <&&&> Tell us about some cold cities . <&&&> In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . <&&&> Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? I am looking for a blouse . Can you show me the way , please ? <&&&> OK , what style do you want ? It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? <&&&> Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . <&&&> Yes . I went to the doctor yesterday . <&&&> I beg your pardon ? <&&&> I said I had been to the doctor the day before . This is my admission card , and these are the books . <&&&> OK , a moment , please . <&&&> By the way , can I renew the borrowing ? <&&&> For which one ? <&&&> Sense and Sensibility , English version . <&&&> Yes , of course . <&&&> Can I just do it here ? <&&&> Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter . <&&&> OK , thanks . Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? <&&&> Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . I need help picking out a lotion . <&&&> It would be my pleasure to help you . What do you need help with ? <&&&> I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching . <&&&> We have Techne , and it is available in lotion or cream . <&&&> Do you find that one works better than the other ? <&&&> I have heard that the cream is longer lasting . <&&&> Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching ? <&&&> If you take an antihistamine , that would help a lot . What are you doing ? <&&&> I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . <&&&> There are no countries marked on the map . Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ? <&&&> The mangoes are on sale today . <&&&> What exactly are mangoes ? <&&&> They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed . <&&&> Is the seed edible ? <&&&> Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it . <&&&> How much does a mango cost ? <&&&> Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each . <&&&> Maybe I won't like the taste . <&&&> It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of acidity . <&&&> How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ? I want take shell on a date , but I don ’ t have much money . <&&&> What does she like to do ? <&&&> She likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food . <&&&> Sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes . <&&&> Well , I really like being with her . <&&&> Have you thought about going in Dutch ? I need to pay the fine on my ticket . <&&&> Do you have the ticket with you ? <&&&> Yes , I have my ticket with me . <&&&> Let me see your ID . Speed Airlines Reservation .

Is that all right ? <&&&> Is it a direct flight ? Paul , a company called me for an interview . <&&&> That's great ! You need to prepare for it . I heard that EDD has special services to help me get a job . <&&&> callous is a great Internet-based placement service that is available to you . <&&&> I don ’ t have access to a computer . <&&&> There is an area at the EDD Center that is set up with computers for you to make use of . <&&&> Is there anything else at the EDD offices to help me with my job search ? <&&&> We can provide you with information that will help you understand what is available . We also provide workshops . <&&&> If I go to EDD in person , what type of workshops might I find there ? <&&&> Our two most important workshops are Resume Writing and Interviewing . <&&&> What are some other places where I might look for work ?

Can your dog do any tricks ? Hello . Manchester 6739792 . Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . <&&&> Ok . I understand that we basically work from 8 thirty to 5 thirty with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? <&&&> That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . Good evening , sir . can I help you ? What was the movie you saw last night ? Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? <&&&> Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . <&&&> What for ? <&&&> So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . <&&&> That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? <&&&> You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? <&&&> Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . <&&&> Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . <&&&> Please go ahead , I am listening . <&&&> I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . <&&&> Is your back door higher than the ground level ? <&&&> Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . <&&&> Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . <&&&> I don't like things to be fancy . <&&&> Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . <&&&> Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? <&&&> Cedar is a good choice . What's your hobby ? I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . What's the special today ? <&&&> ' All-you-can-eat ' dinner special . <&&&> I don't like to . <&&&> Do you care for seafood ? <&&&> Yes , I'm very fond of seafood . <&&&> Which seafood do you prefer ? <&&&> I'd like to have red cooked sea cucumber . <&&&> Is there anything else you would like to have ? <&&&> Bring me an assorted cold dish , please . <&&&> Would you care for beverage ? <&&&> No , thanks . I'm fine . <&&&> What would you like to drink ? Would you please explain for me what a business contract implies ? What about a medication to help me with my problem ? <&&&> There are several types of medications that we can try for your high blood pressure . <&&&> What types of medications would be best ? <&&&> For water retention , I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . <&&&> What are the side effects from taking that drug , <&&&> You need to stay hydrated on this drug , but most people experience little side effects . <&&&> Will that one medication take care of all of my problems ? <&&&> For now I want you to take a second drug , Lisinopril , an ACE inhibitor . It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? <&&&> It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . <&&&> What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? <&&&> It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . <&&&> That doesn't sound pretty . <&&&> Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? <&&&> Well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . <&&&> You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . <&&&> I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? <&&&> I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . <&&&> If you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! <&&&> If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . <&&&> That sounds like fun . What's the bonus like at your company ? <&&&> Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . <&&&> Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! <&&&> Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . <&&&> Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . <&&&> Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . <&&&> What did you buy ? How can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . I think what I am using now does not fit me well . <&&&> We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers . <&&&> What do you have in foundation ? <&&&> Our foundation is of very super quality . We only use the finest ingredients . It will moisturize your skin and it can protect your skin from UVA and UVB . <&&&> What colors do you have in foundation ? <&&&> Let me show you . We have six colors <&&&> The color I use now is natural beige . How much do you sell it for ? <&&&> 250 Yuan . <&&&> That's expensive . <&&&> What you're paying for , madam , is the ingredients . it provides a soft and perfect finish coverage with a weightless feel . <&&&> I understand . I need a lipstick , too . Do you have lipsticks in red ? <&&&> Of course . But I suggest you buy a lipgloss . The shining effect is in . <&&&> All right . How much is it ? Mom ! ? ? ? <&&&> I know , sweetie . Just open wide . Don't talk . <&&&> Mmm ... Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? <&&&> Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . <&&&> Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . <&&&> Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . <&&&> What about the outer packing ? <&&&> We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . <&&&> Cartons ? <&&&> Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . <&&&> Could you use wooden cases instead ? <&&&> Why use wooden cases ? <&&&> I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . <&&&> The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . <&&&> Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . Honey , would you marry me ? <&&&> I want to think about it for some time . <&&&> Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times . <&&&> I know . But your way doesn't touch my heart . <&&&> Oh , god , please tell me how . <&&&> I can't tell you . <&&&> OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you . <&&&> When I am angry and want to beat someone , you stand there and let me do what I want .

I was looking for the Resume Writing Workshop . <&&&> You came to the right spot . Come on in and join us ! <&&&> I am not really sure that I remember how to even put a resume together . <&&&> I am here to show you how to put together the perfect resume . It will turn out great ! <&&&> How do we get started ? <&&&> We need to put our name and contact information across the top . What can I do for you , sir ? <&&&> I want to have a bath . Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? <&&&> Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . <&&&> What was that ? <&&&> Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . <&&&> Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . <&&&> Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . <&&&> I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! <&&&> He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! <&&&> Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . <&&&> How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? Oh , what a beautiful garden ! I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race . <&&&> Excuse me.What did you say ? <&&&> A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games Can I see your ticket please ? Where are you studying and what's your major ? <&&&> I am studying at Beijing University . I major in Civil Law . <&&&> Why did you choose Beijing University ? <&&&> Because Beijing University is the best university in China and I'm sure I am one of the best students . <&&&> What courses have you learned ? How are things with you ? <&&&> I ’ m fine . Thank you . <&&&> How may I help you ? <&&&> I need to make a deposit . <&&&> Will you be depositing cash or a check ? <&&&> I will be depositing cash . <&&&> How much would you like to deposit ? <&&&> It ’ s going to be $ 300 . <&&&> What account would you like to deposit that into ? Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? <&&&> Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? <&&&> I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . <&&&> Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . <&&&> Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . <&&&> Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . <&&&> But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . <&&&> That's why people's achievement varies greatly . Alison , would you like to have some more ? <&&&> No , thanks . I've had enough . <&&&> Actually you haven't had much . <&&&> To tell you the truth , I am on a diet . <&&&> That sounds ridiculous . Why ? Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? <&&&> Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . <&&&> I see . And how about the working hours ? <&&&> Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . <&&&> Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . <&&&> Good , as long as you understand that . Terrible . How about people's lives ? <&&&> Fortunately , there is no person died . <&&&> That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . <&&&> Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . <&&&> That's why many people died in the earthquake . Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ? <&&&> Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . <&&&> Really ? Does he chase balls ? <&&&> Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch . <&&&> This can't be the same dog . He's so clean , he shines . <&&&> See , he's wagging his tail . Hello . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? <&&&> Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? <&&&> What ’ s this form for ? <&&&> This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . <&&&> That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? <&&&> Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . <&&&> Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? <&&&> Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . <&&&> Then , what do you think I should do ? <&&&> My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . Good afternoon . <&&&> Hello . This is Jones . I'd like to speak to Mr . Chen . Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? <&&&> I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? <&&&> I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . <&&&> Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . <&&&> Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . <&&&> But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? <&&&> Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . <&&&> I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? <&&&> That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . <&&&> Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? <&&&> Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . <&&&> How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? <&&&> That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . <&&&> So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? <&&&> Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . <&&&> Why did they want to found a college ? <&&&> Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . <&&&> Oh , I see . <&&&> Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . <&&&> When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . <&&&> Yeah . <&&&> Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . <&&&> Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . <&&&> It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . <&&&> I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . <&&&> Then fans don't see you much in public places . <&&&> Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . You did an excellent job in this project . <&&&> Thank you . It was a lot of hard work.But I'm glad I did it . <&&&> Congratulations . <&&&> When will you give me a raise ? Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the railway station ? <&&&> Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters . You can ’ t miss it . <&&&> About how long will it take me to get there ? <&&&> It ’ s about 20 minutes ’ walk , I think . <&&&> I see . Is there a bus I can take ? <&&&> Yes , you can take the No . 5 bus over there . Get off at the next stop . <&&&> Thank you so much for your help . Steven , have you got better now ? <&&&> Yeah , the doctor said that I can leave soon . I really miss home . <&&&> I guess you miss your wife and children very much . <&&&> Yeah , you are right . But I have to stay for another day for observation . <&&&> If necessary , I can stay here to accompany you until you are discharged . <&&&> No , thanks . I am very grateful that you can come to the hospital to visit me . What do you do in your spare time ? <&&&> I listen to music and read . <&&&> What kind of music do you like ? Graham , why are you always on the phone with Jane ? <&&&> Because we are partners in our science lab . Why are you so jealous ? <&&&> The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . How do you explain that ? <&&&> My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek . <&&&> Are you sure ? <&&&> Of course I am . I only love you , Amy . <&&&> Okay , I'm sorry . I believe you . <&&&> Why do you always accuse me like that ? Anything else I can do for you ? <&&&> I need ten 55 cents stamps and ten 32 cents stamps , please . <&&&> OK , here you are.Anything else ? <&&&> Yes , I need to send the payment to immigration for my aunt's citizenship application . They won't accept checks.How do I send the money ? <&&&> You can buy a money order and mail mature immigration . <&&&> Then I need a money order for 250 dollars . <&&&> Please fill out the form for the money order.You also need to pay a one dollar fee . <&&&> Thank youse much for all your help . <&&&> You're welcome.Have a nice day . Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? <&&&> It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! <&&&> Where did you end up going ? <&&&> Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . <&&&> I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? <&&&> That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? <&&&> Sure . What's this one a picture of ? <&&&> Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . <&&&> You don't look very happy in that picture . <&&&> No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! <&&&> So what did you do ? <&&&> We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . <&&&> My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! <&&&> What ? What did you buy ? <&&&> It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! <&&&> What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? <&&&> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . <&&&> And ? <&&&> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . <&&&> And it's a brick ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? <&&&> I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . <&&&> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . <&&&> Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . <&&&> But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? <&&&> He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . <&&&> Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! <&&&> C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . <&&&> That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? <&&&> Yes , here you go . Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . <&&&> Let ’ s see ... “ Wanted <&&&> Come on , what have you got to lose ? <&&&> What about my resume ? What's your products ' competitive edge ? Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . <&&&> I strongly urge you to change your diet.You shouldn't eat too many desserts . <&&&> Nothing works with my toothache now . <&&&> You should go to the dentist . <&&&> I hate dentists . Name and examination number , please . <&&&> My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . <&&&> What part of the country do you come from ? <&&&> I ’ m from Living , Yunnan Province . Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ? <&&&> There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ? <&&&> Great . Let's go . Where is it ? <&&&> Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . <&&&> We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ? <&&&> I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms . <&&&> So let's go and catch earth worms ! <&&&> OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . <&&&> Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing . Why did you choose Applied Sociology as your major ? I have to move . <&&&> You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet . <&&&> I can ’ t stay here anymore . <&&&> There ’ s a problem with that . <&&&> What is the problem ? <&&&> I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit . <&&&> Why not ? Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station ? <&&&> Do you live in Pasadena ? <&&&> My house is up in Altadena . I can see by your resume here that you studied business administration . <&&&> That's right . <&&&> So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper . <&&&> I did reporting for the university newspaper in my school.And I always be very interested in journalism . <&&&> But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ? <&&&> I study the administration.Yes.But I'm more attracted to writing articles . I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news . <&&&> A new reporter must expect to work many hours . My name is Steven Smith and I'm calling to cancel my plane ticket . <&&&> When was your reservation ? <&&&> It ’ s 7 p . m . today . <&&&> Would you mind telling me the reason ? <&&&> I need to continue to deal with my business .

How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? <&&&> Two . French and Spanish . <&&&> And how well can you speak them ? <&&&> Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . Do you have a bf ? <&&&> Yes , I had a bf before . <&&&> Why you say bf before ? <&&&> We parted from each other last month . Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? <&&&> No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? <&&&> You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? <&&&> No , Officer , not at all . <&&&> Then how can you explain your behavior ? <&&&> Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer . <&&&> Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? <&&&> Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . <&&&> On a cell phone ? <&&&> Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions . I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees . <&&&> Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today . <&&&> I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . <&&&> You mean , if there is any left over ? <&&&> Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games . <&&&> That's okay . I can explain a little . <&&&> I don't want to lose all my money . <&&&> Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . <&&&> I guess you're right . I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! <&&&> There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? <&&&> Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . <&&&> Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? <&&&> No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? <&&&> I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . <&&&> I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ? What's so special today ? <&&&> Why ? Shall I make some coffee , Jane ? <&&&> That's a good idea , Charlotte . <&&&> It's ready . Do you want any milk ? <&&&> Just a little please . <&&&> What about some sugar ? Two teaspoonfuls ? <&&&> No , less than that . One and a half teaspoonfuls please . That's enough for me .

What can I do for you ? <&&&> I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ? <&&&> I'd like to . How do you like the hat ? <&&&> It's not special . It can be seen everywhere . <&&&> How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful . <&&&> It's interesting . Let me see . Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? <&&&> I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles . <&&&> I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . Do you have anything to declare ? <&&&> No . I have nothing . <&&&> Are these all your personal things ? <&&&> Yes , they are .

It's so much fun . <&&&> I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? <&&&> Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . <&&&> Well , every stamp has a story to tell . <&&&> You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps . <&&&> Good . <&&&> Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections . <&&&> There's a lot to share when you have a common interest . <&&&> Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors . <&&&> Ok , good luck . See you What does your company do exactly ? So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? <&&&> Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . <&&&> Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . Who's that ? <&&&> Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . <&&&> Is that your cousin in the back ? <&&&> Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . <&&&> You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . <&&&> What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? <&&&> I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... <&&&> And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . <&&&> Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . <&&&> Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport <&&&> Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . <&&&> I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ? <&&&> I don't really know where I want to go . I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant . <&&&> There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper . I ’ m having a problem . <&&&> What ’ s the problem ? <&&&> A pipe burst in my wall . I'm sorry . I've lost my tags and receipt . How can I do about it ? <&&&> I see . What is your baggage ? And do not remember the tag's number or color ? <&&&> It's a suitcase . But I've forgot the exact color . Maybe it is red or something . <&&&> Could you give me a description of your case ? <&&&> It's like this . It's square with a leather cover . Yes , I remember , there is a green string around the handle . That's right . <&&&> I'll check it for you ... sorry to keep you waiting . I've found it.Is this yours ? <&&&> Yes , It is the right one . <&&&> Will you show me your key card , please ? I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . <&&&> That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . <&&&> But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . <&&&> Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . <&&&> I know you're right , but what can I do ? <&&&> How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? Could you tell me your education background ? Usually cities have greater traffic problems . <&&&> Of course , there're too many people . What shall we do now ? <&&&> Let's get the table wares we need first , And then stand in the line . Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? <&&&> Fine . I miss you so much , uncle Benjamin . <&&&> Me too . We haven't seen each other for years . <&&&> It's been 3 years now . <&&&> How time flies ! Now you are a college student out of a little girl . Lisa , I'm home . <&&&> How was your day ? <&&&> Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . <&&&> Anybody I know ? <&&&> Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? <&&&> Of course . You didn't have to ask me . <&&&> That's what Pam said . Finally we're on board ! <&&&> Yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . <&&&> Are they window seats or aisle seats ? <&&&> Let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle . <&&&> Ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . <&&&> That's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . What day is today ? <&&&> Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two . This is the house I want to rent . Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? What's happening , officer ? <&&&> There is a fire in your building . You need to evacuate immediately . <&&&> What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . <&&&> I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . <&&&> do you feel ok ? <&&&> not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . <&&&> why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . <&&&> could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? <&&&> you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . <&&&> ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . <&&&> Zach , what's that on your arm ? <&&&> I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . <&&&> it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? <&&&> just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . <&&&> I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go . <&&&> shouldn't we make an appointment first ? Alison , would you like to have some more ? <&&&> No thanks . I have had enough . <&&&> Actually you haven't have much . <&&&> To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . <&&&> That sounds ridiculous . Why ? Look what you've done ! <&&&> I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . <&&&> Yes , and hurry up ! <&&&> I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? <&&&> No , I'll do it myself . <&&&> Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? <&&&> I should think so , too ! I don't know if you remember , but with honest every day last year we tided the knot . <&&&> Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget . <&&&> How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you . <&&&> They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . <&&&> You are more beautiful than the roses . <&&&> I don't know how , but I love you more than the day we gotta married . <&&&> Yes , we are match made in heaven . We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? <&&&> We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . <&&&> No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? <&&&> We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . <&&&> Are you kidding ? I'm having problems with my computer . <&&&> What's wrong with it ? This section of the store is called Junior . Why is that ? <&&&> It means young girls . That's where you'll find clothes for young girls . <&&&> But I can't find anything in my size here . Hello , this is Sunshine Trading Company . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment . <&&&> Great . Could you tell me something about cash control ? Jack , what are you doing ? <&&&> I am reading . Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? <&&&> Go ahead , please . <&&&> How long is my paid vacation every year ? <&&&> You'll have 10 days paid vacation every year . <&&&> What about the insurance and housing policies ? <&&&> We will provide you with life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . <&&&> How often is the bonus ? <&&&> You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . <&&&> Do I have training opportunities ? <&&&> We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . <&&&> Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think for a couple of days before I give you my final answer . Where did you work in the past ? <&&&> For the past 5 years , I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co , Ltd . Would you like to see our new shirts ? <&&&> Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . How may I help you , miss ? <&&&> I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? <&&&> Would you like to have a perm ? Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life . <&&&> It would be good for both if they lived separately . My parents want to live apart from us . <&&&> What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ? <&&&> Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities . If it's needed , they would live with their parents . <&&&> When I ’ m old , I ’ ll also be like that . <&&&> You need a child first , and that's your duty , too . Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? <&&&> I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . <&&&> I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? Can you help me find a nice gift for my young niece ? <&&&> Barbie dolls are quite popular , you know . <&&&> You're right . Girls love Barbie . Show me a Barbie doll . <&&&> Take a look at the newest Barbie — Digital Barbie . <&&&> She's beautiful . What's the price for Digital Barbie ? <&&&> Our regular price for Digital Barbie is $ 29.95 plus tax . <&&&> Only $ 29.95 ? I'll buy it , of course . <&&&> Another one sold . Do you see anything else you would like ? <&&&> Thank you , but no . This will do it for now . <&&&> Tax brings your total to $ 32.42 . How would you like to pay ? Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit . <&&&> Are you a professor ? <&&&> What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old ! <&&&> Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? <&&&> Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well . <&&&> Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . <&&&> It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk . <&&&> Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university . <&&&> My permission letter ? <&&&> Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place . <&&&> I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office . <&&&> Yes . Or you can bring it yourself . <&&&> But I asked them to send it to you directly . Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . <&&&> Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . <&&&> Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? <&&&> This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! <&&&> That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? <&&&> No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . <&&&> So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? <&&&> I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? <&&&> No . What ? <&&&> He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . <&&&> No . Really , what happened ? <&&&> Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . <&&&> Was he out with the guys from the bank ? <&&&> Yes , I think so . <&&&> Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . <&&&> Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . <&&&> Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . <&&&> No , she left him last year . <&&&> Oh , really ? Do you know why ? <&&&> Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? <&&&> He lost his wallet and keys . <&&&> Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . The road ahead is blocked .

Jill , how do you like your new job ? <&&&> I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . <&&&> I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . <&&&> Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . Hello ! Do you have a place where I can exercise ? <&&&> Yes , sir . We have a fine exercise facility . <&&&> I'm happy to hear that . Now , would you tell me where it is ? <&&&> You're actually standing above it . Just take the elevator or stairs down one level . <&&&> Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use ? <&&&> No , sir . There's no extra charge . All you need is your room key to open the door . <&&&> And the gym hours are ? <&&&> Sir , you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes . Excuse me , I'm looking for a good novel . Can you recommend anything ? <&&&> Certainly . What kind of novel did you have in mind ? <&&&> I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good . <&&&> Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller . <&&&> Sorry , I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much , either . <&&&> That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? <&&&> Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now . <&&&> There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend . <&&&> I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else . <&&&> How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done . <&&&> That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help . I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? <&&&> Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . <&&&> Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? <&&&> Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . <&&&> Could you move smoothly ? <&&&> Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . I think I may try to eat a little better . <&&&> I changed my diet recently , and I eat a lot healthier now . <&&&> What do you eat ? Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ? <&&&> I ’ m looking for a bookcase , but I don ’ t want to buy a new one . <&&&> Are you having any luck ? <&&&> Not really . There aren ’ t any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I ’ ll go to them . <&&&> Do you mind if I go with you ? do you need a hand ? <&&&> no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway . <&&&> are you sure you don't need any help ? <&&&> well , maybe just a little . I can't seem to make it fit . <&&&> I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller ! <&&&> that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ? <&&&> yes . What about you ? <&&&> I'm in the middle seat . <&&&> oh , I guess I'll let you through then . <&&&> thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again . <&&&> that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ? What would you reckon the taxing increases ? <&&&> Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . What do you usually do in your work time ? <&&&> Some routine job . Files , documents , faxes and so on . You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? <&&&> I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . <&&&> What was your childhood like ? <&&&> I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me . <&&&> Where did you go to university ? <&&&> My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . <&&&> What is your current occupation ? <&&&> I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . <&&&> Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ? <&&&> No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . <&&&> Do you like your current job ? If one is rich , is the happy ? <&&&> I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness . <&&&> Could I understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest ? Are you through with your meal ? <&&&> Yes , I am . Could I have the bill , please ? Jack , what do you think about the election ? <&&&> I think the campaign is a blockbuster . <&&&> How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? <&&&> Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . <&&&> Who do you think will be elected ? <&&&> It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . May I show you to your room ? <&&&> Ok . <&&&> Here , let me help you with your bags . good morning . What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> good morning , doctor . I feel terrible . I ’ Ve got a cold and I have a rash here on my neck . I ’ m not sleeping well either . What do you think the problem could be ? <&&&> I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ? <&&&> yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days . <&&&> good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . <&&&> OK . I can afford to take a fell days off work . <&&&> have you been working hard recently ? <&&&> yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little . <&&&> good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other Sy <&&&> I have a bad headache , but ... <&&&> don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use an Excuse me , but I ’ m a bit lost here . Where does this street lead to ? <&&&> The Queen Street , I guess . <&&&> So is it the right way to the City Hall ? Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed . <&&&> I certainly have . <&&&> When did this happen ? <&&&> About two hours ago . <&&&> Why didn't you report it before ? <&&&> I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . <&&&> Please tell me exactly what happened . <&&&> I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it . What do you think of the test ? Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . <&&&> What part hurts ? <&&&> The shoulder . <&&&> Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . <&&&> It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . <&&&> C'mon . Just don't move . <&&&> I'm bleeding too much . <&&&> We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? <&&&> Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! <&&&> There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . <&&&> Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . <&&&> Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . <&&&> No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . <&&&> Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? <&&&> I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! Good ! There's the information desk . How do we get to the 70th Street , please ? You ’ re new here , right ? The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! <&&&> Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . <&&&> On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . <&&&> As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . <&&&> I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . <&&&> What is the greenhouse effect exactly ? Our current apartment is valued at RIB 700,000 . We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment . <&&&> Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it . <&&&> And we can take out a loan to pay the rest . Do you want to practice your driving right now ? <&&&> No problem . We can do it right now . <&&&> Are you buckled up ? <&&&> All right . Now what do I do ? <&&&> Start the car . <&&&> Which way do you want me to go ? <&&&> Take a left . <&&&> How far do you want me to go ? <&&&> I'll tell you when to stop . <&&&> Just make sure to tell me beforehand . <&&&> We're back now , so why don't you try parking ? Do you have a boyfriend ? <&&&> Yes . Why ? <&&&> Well , I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common . <&&&> So ? <&&&> So I think I may fall in love with her . <&&&> You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? <&&&> Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? <&&&> That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . <&&&> That's what I did . <&&&> And you think about her all the time ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . <&&&> That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ? <&&&> I didn't have any big plans . <&&&> We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . <&&&> That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? <&&&> We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . <&&&> Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester . <&&&> Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings ? <&&&> I am a daytime student . Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ? <&&&> In response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . Mom , I finished . <&&&> OK . Could you please help me to clean them ? <&&&> Of course . Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . <&&&> But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? <&&&> That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . <&&&> That ’ s too bad . <&&&> Thank you for your hospitality . <&&&> Thanks for coming . <&&&> How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . <&&&> Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card . <&&&> Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . <&&&> I'm finished . <&&&> I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form , please . <&&&> OK , the form is all filled out . <&&&> Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ? <&&&> No , I have no idea what they are . <&&&> Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout . <&&&> Yes , right . Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale ? <&&&> Well , we've got some great mangoes on sale . What is the matter with him ? <&&&> I don't know , what's wrong ? <&&&> I feel he is as cold as charity to me . Excuse me , sir . May I go with you to claim my luggage ? I am a stranger here . Excuse me , doc . I am not feeling well . Can you help me ? <&&&> Yes , but not here . Have you got registered yet ? <&&&> No , I haven't . Where do I go for that ? <&&&> The registration office . Did you bring your records with you ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Is anybody here with you ? Parents or siblings ? <&&&> No , I'm here all by myself . <&&&> You are a brave kid . Go ahead to the registration office first , then to the doctors . <&&&> But I don't know where the registration office is . <&&&> It's in the hall on the first floor . Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? <&&&> Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . <&&&> Wow . You look great . What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? <&&&> I'm sorry . I forget all about it . <&&&> How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . Hello , JC Consulting PLC . Chris Edwards speaking . <&&&> Mr Edwards , this is Kristy calling from IBA . <&&&> Hi Kristy !

I would like to have this laundry done . <&&&> Please fill out the form first . Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning . <&&&> What ’ s up ? <&&&> I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow . <&&&> America ? Did you get admit to MIT ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Really going to miss you . Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen . <&&&> high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . <&&&> It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . Good afternoon , miss , can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I ’ d like to buy this dress , please . <&&&> It ’ s certainly a pretty dress . I can ring you up at the register over here . <&&&> Great . <&&&> Will you be paying by cash , check , or credit card ? <&&&> I want to use a credit card . Do you take Discover ? <&&&> Sorry , no . We only take MasterCard or Visa . <&&&> I ’ ll put it on my Visa card , then . <&&&> Very well , ma ’ am . Oh , there seems to be a problem , it says it ’ s rejected . <&&&> There must be something wrong with the system . Try my MasterCard . <&&&> Alright . Thank you . Yes , it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199.00 , sign here , please . <&&&> Sure . <&&&> Here you go , and here ’ s your receipt . Have a nice day . What are you doing this weekend ? <&&&> I am not sure . What are you doing ? <&&&> I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . <&&&> That sounds like a great idea ! You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? <&&&> Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . <&&&> But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? <&&&> It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . <&&&> That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . <&&&> Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . Could I make a reservation for Flight 10 to Tokyo ? <&&&> I'm sorry , but everything is taken . It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? I want to offer you more invoking stock options . <&&&> When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? What would you like for dessert ? <&&&> What do you have ? <&&&> I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . <&&&> Can I have apple pie with ice cream ? <&&&> Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . <&&&> I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . <&&&> what did you argue about ? <&&&> he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . <&&&> well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . <&&&> yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . <&&&> did you lend him a lot of money ? <&&&> not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . Hello , Fairbrook Consulting , how may I help you ? <&&&> Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms .

Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! <&&&> Wow ! Sure ! <&&&> I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . <&&&> Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! <&&&> I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . <&&&> I'd love to help if I can . <&&&> Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! <&&&> Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . <&&&> But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? <&&&> Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . <&&&> I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . <&&&> Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? I will have sole then . <&&&> All right , how about the other guests . <&&&> The rest of us will have this today's special , please . <&&&> Ok . <&&&> I am sorry but I ordered sole not the same as the others .

Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company . <&&&> Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . <&&&> That's right . <&&&> After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . <&&&> I couldn't agree more . <&&&> And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . <&&&> What can I do next ? <&&&> The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . <&&&> Look . Some of the faxes come through blurred . What is wrong with it ? Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale ? <&&&> Well , we've got some great mangoes on sale . <&&&> Mangoes ? What are mangoes ? <&&&> Well , it's a fruit with a big seed in it . <&&&> Can you eat the seed ? <&&&> No .

I'm afraid not . <&&&> Oh , I see . How about the charges ? <&&&> The charges vary according to the types of call you make . The cheapest is a station-to-stcrtion call , then a person-to-person call . The mini charge will apply for the first three minutes , then each additional minute will be charged . <&&&> Oh , let me think of it ... Could you put through a collect cal for me ? <&&&> Certainly . Who are you calling ? <&&&> It's a Mrs . Peters , Marilyn Peters . <&&&> And what's the number you are calling ? How is your English ability ? <&&&> Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . <&&&> Could you tell me something about your English education ? <&&&> I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors . Do you have a room available for this weekend ? <&&&> Yes , we have several rooms available . Would you like two twin beds or one queen size bed ? why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! <&&&> oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . <&&&> it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . <&&&> but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . <&&&> why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . <&&&> she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . <&&&> that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? <&&&> I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . <&&&> I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . <&&&> I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? <&&&> just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . <&&&> do you think it will work ? <&&&> sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . <&&&> ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? <&&&> No , I ’ m not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? <&&&> You ’ re not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That ’ s 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? <&&&> No , Officer , not at all . <&&&> Then how can you explain your behavior ? <&&&> Well , I guess I just wasn ’ t paying attention to the speedometer . <&&&> Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? <&&&> Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . <&&&> On a cell phone ? Are there other chores for us to do ? <&&&> We also have to vacuum the house . <&&&> You used to do this by yourself ? <&&&> You'd better believe it . <&&&> I'll do the second floor and you do the first floor .

No man could ever make anything like this . <&&&> What is that below ? <&&&> It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish . <&&&> No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me . <&&&> There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . Dad , can you help me ? <&&&> Oh , honey , you made a mistake . <&&&> I don't know how to do it . Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat . Hello . Can I talk to Miss Li , please ? <&&&> I beg you pardon ? Miss who ? I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you . <&&&> Would mornings or afternoons be best for you ? <&&&> It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon . <&&&> It is best if we can go during the week ; does that work for you ? <&&&> Because of work , I can only go look at houses on the weekend . Excuse me , are you American ? <&&&> No . <&&&> Do you speak English ? <&&&> A little , but not very well . <&&&> How long have you been here ? <&&&> 2 months . <&&&> What do you do for work ? <&&&> I'm a student .

They might be helpful . <&&&> Can I check this one out ? do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? <&&&> not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? <&&&> sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? <&&&> have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? <&&&> yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? <&&&> that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? <&&&> to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . What can I help you with today ? <&&&> I have a problem . <&&&> What is the problem ? <&&&> I wrote a check for $ 100 and it bounced . <&&&> Do you have enough money in your account ? <&&&> I think so . <&&&> Let me check that for you right now . <&&&> Okay .

I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow . <&&&> I know . It's going to be so much fun . <&&&> I always get excited the day before . <&&&> I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore . <&&&> I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me . <&&&> That makes sense . Would you like a cup of coffee ? <&&&> No , thank you . <&&&> I'm going to get one for myself . They make really good coffee here . Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ? <&&&> I ’ m looking for a bookcase , but I don ’ t want to buy a new one . <&&&> Are you having any luck ? <&&&> Not really . There aren ’ t any used bookcases listed .

I know something you don't know ! <&&&> What's that ? <&&&> How many planets are there in the solar system ? <&&&> That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . <&&&> Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! I'd like to have this cashed , please . <&&&> Please put you name and address here . May I see your passport ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> How would you like it ? Have you heard about the new iPhone ? <&&&> yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ?

You look upset , is there anything wrong ? <&&&> Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . Dad , when will you finish your cooking ? <&&&> Several minutes . <&&&> So what should I do now ? <&&&> Then , pass me a bowl for the soup . Have you bought your bus pass yet ? <&&&> I didn't get it yet . <&&&> Well , why not ? <&&&> I have no idea where to get it from . Hello , Kevin .

Call me when you get back . <&&&> I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ? <&&&> It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ? <&&&> The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements . <&&&> Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway . <&&&> There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV . <&&&> Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . <&&&> No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . <&&&> Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? I'd like to order a restock on my minibar . <&&&> You finished everything in there , sir ? <&&&> Absolutely everything . <&&&> What would you like to order ? <&&&> Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam . <&&&> Uh-huh . What else do you want ? Is the girl in red your girlfriend ? Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women .

Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well . <&&&> Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package , too . <&&&> Great . How much is this going to cost ? <&&&> Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? <&&&> What ’ s the difference ? <&&&> Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online . This bus goes all the way to Santa Anita mall , right ? <&&&> Yeah , it'll take us there . <&&&> Are you positive ? <&&&> I always catch this bus . <&&&> How long is this bus ride ? <&&&> It only takes about half an hour . <&&&> Where do we get off at ? Hello ! How are you . <&&&> Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days . <&&&> What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? <&&&> That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . <&&&> Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . <&&&> Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual . Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . <&&&> Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . <&&&> No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . <&&&> Oh yes ! Sorry !

Excuse me . <&&&> Yes ? <&&&> Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? <&&&> Certainly.Go along Queen's Road ... <&&&> Along Queen's Road ... <&&&> Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . <&&&> Right at the Hilton . <&&&> Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . <&&&> The Cathedral ? Long Distance . May I help you ? It's really late but I'm starving . <&&&> Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . <&&&> Maybe they have some good pie . <&&&> I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . <&&&> There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . <&&&> Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . <&&&> Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . Hello , Mr . Brown . How are you today ? Excuse me . <&&&> Yeah ? <&&&> I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ? <&&&> You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy . <&&&> Yes , but ... well ... <&&&> What ? <&&&> How do I use the machines ? <&&&> What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers . <&&&> I see . Do the machines have soap in them ? <&&&> No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ? <&&&> No . I don't have soap . <&&&> Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . <&&&> Thanks.Okay . I have my soap . <&&&> My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? <&&&> I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean . <&&&> But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out . <&&&> Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before . <&&&> What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ? What's the time now ? <&&&> Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . <&&&> You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? <&&&> In the coming , before going to work . <&&&> You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it . <&&&> OK . I'll turn it on . <&&&> All right . It's just four o'clock . What ? <&&&> What happened with that guy at the cafe ? <&&&> nothing . <&&&> But you ’ re crazy about him . <&&&> Yes , I am . <&&&> Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? <&&&> I don ’ t actually know him . <&&&> Really ? Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ? <&&&> Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now . <&&&> Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ? <&&&> I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ? <&&&> Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side . Can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? <&&&> Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . <&&&> Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . <&&&> You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . Do you have wake-up service ? <&&&> Yes.You can use the computer to seta tima.Dial 10 and then time.For example.if you want to get up at 7:15 , you can dial 100715 . <&&&> OK . I understand . Guess who I saw yesterday ? <&&&> Who ? <&&&> My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? Excuse me . I've been waiting here for 15 mins . Do you know how often does No . 3 run ? <&&&> Oh , it runs every 20 mins . You must have missed it , when you came here . It should be here any minute now . <&&&> It seems that you have got here at a good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? <&&&> Yes , I do . You can go to the Transport Department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map . You ’ re all set now ? <&&&> Oh , thank you so much . <&&&> Really , it was nothing . <&&&> I really appreciated it . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I was looking for a book , but I couldn ’ t find it . <&&&> Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf ? <&&&> I already did . <&&&> Is it on the shelf ? What should I get Uncle Teddy ? <&&&> You could get him a tie . <&&&> Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . <&&&> Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . <&&&> That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . <&&&> He would think you were crazy , Caroline . <&&&> Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . <&&&> How much do you want to spend ? <&&&> Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . <&&&> Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . <&&&> What should he have then ? <&&&> I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . <&&&> I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? <&&&> I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . <&&&> Alright . We can go later then . <&&&> We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . <&&&> Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? <&&&> She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . <&&&> Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . <&&&> Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . <&&&> Why are we watching it anyway ? <&&&> Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . <&&&> True . True . <&&&> Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? <&&&> Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? <&&&> Of course . <&&&> You want something to drink ? <&&&> Yeah , Got a Coke ? <&&&> Sure . Excuse me , sir ? I just need a little bit more information .

What about the supply position ? <&&&> For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply . <&&&> Here's our inquiry list . You'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there . <&&&> Thanks . I'll look into it and let you have our firm offers tomorrow . <&&&> I don't need to remind you that the market has become very competitive . <&&&> You'll find our prices very favorable .

How do you think people get their personalities ? <&&&> I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . <&&&> Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? <&&&> No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . <&&&> So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . <&&&> Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . <&&&> You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv .

But we don't know who can stay with her . <&&&> You need a babysitter . <&&&> Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . <&&&> I could have Suzy stay at my place . <&&&> I don't want to do that to you , Karen . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . <&&&> I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . <&&&> I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . <&&&> I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . <&&&> I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother .

The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . <&&&> Did you have to pay a deposit ? <&&&> No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . <&&&> Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?

You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market . <&&&> Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it .

Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . <&&&> it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . <&&&> alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . <&&&> oh , what is it ? <&&&> it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . <&&&> oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . <&&&> yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . Do you mind if I ask you a question ? <&&&> No , not at all . Go ahead . Are you going to leave school at the end of the term ? <&&&> Yes , I am . <&&&> What are you going to do ? <&&&> I'm going to be a clerk . <&&&> What does a clerk do ?

Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? <&&&> No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? <&&&> Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . <&&&> What was that like ? <&&&> It was always very busy there . ...

I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . <&&&> Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . <&&&> So what items must be involved in this report ? <&&&> First is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year . <&&&> Yeah , is that all ? <&&&> Let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events . <&&&> That's too complicated . <&&&> And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . <&&&> Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ? Your definition on success ? <&&&> Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . <&&&> What ’ s your ideal job ? <&&&> Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . <&&&> How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? <&&&> Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . The world changes , the family changes too . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . <&&&> That is called a nuclear family . <&&&> I don't like such a family . good morning . How can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to open a new account . <&&&> have you filled out an application form ? <&&&> yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? <&&&> yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? <&&&> yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? <&&&> yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . <&&&> that's very convenient . <&&&> it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? What does a housing go for in south mountain district ? <&&&> It depends on the type of the house you're looking for . <&&&> We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home . <&&&> What ’ s your general price range ? <&&&> Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose . <&&&> Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . <&&&> What about a two-bedroom house ? <&&&> A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB . <&&&> I see . Hi , how are you . Is Alice there ? <&&&> Speaking . What's up ? <&&&> Why haven't you answered the phone ? <&&&> My bad , I had chores to do . <&&&> That's all right . <&&&> What was the reason for your call ? <&&&> I want to do something tomorrow with you . <&&&> Sounds good .

If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . <&&&> I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? <&&&> One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! <&&&> When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? <&&&> You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend the <&&&> What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? <&&&> One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out side of your body . <&&&> So I need plenty of space for this exercise .

I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? <&&&> I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . <&&&> But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . <&&&> Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law .

When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . <&&&> but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . <&&&> that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha <&&&> let ’ s think realistically about what might happen .

Which movie did you have in mind ? <&&&> Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . <&&&> that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? <&&&> it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . <&&&> great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ? Do you think it's time to sign the contract , Mr . Simpson ? Oh , no . We ’ re going to be late for the meeting . <&&&> No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway . <&&&> Oh , good . <&&&> How much will it cost ? <&&&> Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars . how's it going ? <&&&> I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? <&&&> to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . <&&&> what's wrong ? <&&&> there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . <&&&> I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? <&&&> sure , but how ? <&&&> you can ask her out for drink after work . <&&&> but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . Your PC is so amazing . Are you doing trade on internet ? <&&&> Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade . <&&&> I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet . <&&&> Yes , I often do business through internet now . <&&&> Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? <&&&> Yes , very gorgeous . Sometimes , I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . <&&&> What advantages does it have ? <&&&> Firstly , it is convenient . And secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service . <&&&> I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . Excuse me . I'm looking for an old music box . <&&&> Any particular decade ? <&&&> Something made in the ' 20s would be nice . <&&&> We had seven , but we sold one this morning . Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages . <&&&> Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you . <&&&> I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ? <&&&> Just fine . How is everything with you ? <&&&> Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? Is there a bus in Altadena that'll take me to downtown LA ? How is your ankle ? Welcome to China , Mr . White . <&&&> How do you do , Ms . Chi ? <&&&> Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . <&&&> Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . <&&&> Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . Do you want some dessert ? <&&&> No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? <&&&> Where is our waitress anyway ? <&&&> Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? <&&&> I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . <&&&> Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . <&&&> So the bill is $ 36.00 . <&&&> How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? <&&&> My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . <&&&> I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . Why don't you watch where you're going ? <&&&> Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! <&&&> There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . <&&&> Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . <&&&> I think my arm is broken . <&&&> Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . <&&&> Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . <&&&> Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . I'm in 507 , and I have a big problem . <&&&> I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir . <&&&> Everywhere I look , I see cockroaches . <&&&> Perhaps you could look again , sir , to double-check . <&&&> The next cockroach I see will be number ten . Hello . Welcome ! So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? <&&&> Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? <&&&> I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . <&&&> Do you know anyone in the play ? <&&&> Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . <&&&> Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? <&&&> That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . OK , Hello ! <&&&> Hello ! <&&&> Hi , what's your name ? <&&&> Yeah , my name is Nandu . <&&&> Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ? <&&&> Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U . How are you ? <&&&> I ’ m great . Thank you for asking . <&&&> What can I do for you ? <&&&> Do I owe any fees ? <&&&> You sure do . <&&&> Could you tell me how much I owe ? <&&&> You owe $ 235.13 in fees . Could I meet with you to discuss the project ? <&&&> Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? <&&&> Tuesday would be good for me . <&&&> OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? <&&&> I think the afternoon would be best . <&&&> That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . <&&&> Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . <&&&> Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? <&&&> I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . <&&&> Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? <&&&> Yes , I know how to get there on my own . Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? So how did your end-of-the-year review go ? <&&&> Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative . <&&&> Did he actually say that ? <&&&> Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . <&&&> Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? <&&&> No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . <&&&> Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . What'll it be today , sir ? <&&&> Fill it up . Super Unleaded . <&&&> Shall we check your oil and tires ? <&&&> I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . Most people in Montreal speak French . What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film ? <&&&> I consider the hero's acting is inferior to that of the heroine's . don't you agree ? Excuse me , This bus goes down town , doesn ’ t it ? <&&&> Yes , where do you want to go ? <&&&> The worker stadium . <&&&> This is the right bus . <&&&> Do you let me know where to get off ? What's the life expectancy in your country ? <&&&> I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? <&&&> About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . <&&&> I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . <&&&> Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . <&&&> Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment . <&&&> How's your son these days ? <&&&> Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . <&&&> He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? <&&&> I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . <&&&> I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . <&&&> Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . <&&&> We are nor alone here . So many other families ! <&&&> Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ? <&&&> I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? <&&&> Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? Are you ready to order now , sir ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Would you like an appetizer ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . <&&&> Would you like some soup first ? <&&&> Very well . <&&&> What kind of soup would you like ? <&&&> I want egg soup . <&&&> Have you decided on anything ? <&&&> I'd like to have some meat . <&&&> How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? <&&&> No , thank you . <&&&> Are you interested in today's special ? <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> Twice cooked spicy pork slices . <&&&> OK . Let me try it . <&&&> Anything else ? I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . <&&&> Would you like orchestra seats ? When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . <&&&> But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . <&&&> And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime . <&&&> And it's all coming down to the next three weeks . How far is this address from here , please ? <&&&> Let me see . Go straight on , then take the first turning on the left . <&&&> So how long does it take ? Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? <&&&> Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . <&&&> His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? <&&&> Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . <&&&> Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . <&&&> Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . <&&&> OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? <&&&> When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? <&&&> The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . <&&&> That's right . Why do you ask ? <&&&> Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . <&&&> When are getting married ? <&&&> Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . Is my car ready yet ? <&&&> I don't know , sir . What's the number of your car ? <&&&> It's LF 312 G . <&&&> When did you bring it to us ? Where do we get off at ? <&&&> I think we have a little ways to go . <&&&> This bus ride is taking forever . <&&&> I know . <&&&> Did we miss our stop ? <&&&> I'm not sure . <&&&> Didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus ? <&&&> I don't know . We may have missed our stop . Hello . <&&&> Hello.May I speak to Mark , please ? <&&&> Sure , just a minute.Mark , you're wanted on the phone . <&&&> Hello , this is Mark speaking . <&&&> Hi ! This is Jill.How come you didn't come in today ? <&&&> Oh , we had a birthday party for David last night . As a matter of fact I woke up with a terrible hangover . Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? <&&&> I like them very much . They are delicious . <&&&> Well , you can have all my carrots . <&&&> Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? <&&&> Nothing . Just that I don't care for these carrots.Hi , sis . , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes . I am done with the main course . It's about time for some dessert . <&&&> Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! <&&&> No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert . And I have had enough carrots . <&&&> Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you . I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert . <&&&> How about going to the theatre ? <&&&> I don't like going to the theatre . <&&&> Well , what do you like doing ? <&&&> Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits . <&&&> Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ? I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . <&&&> Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? <&&&> All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . <&&&> Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! <&&&> Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you . <&&&> Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . <&&&> It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . <&&&> But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? <&&&> Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? <&&&> Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? <&&&> Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . <&&&> It's been a long time ! What's new ? <&&&> Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? <&&&> Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . <&&&> How was it ? <&&&> I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . <&&&> Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport . <&&&> Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? <&&&> He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . <&&&> Is there anything else ? Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . Can I get you something to drink ? <&&&> Sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order . <&&&> So how about an aperitif ? <&&&> It sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . <&&&> Stirred or shaken ? <&&&> Stirred will be fine . <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> Thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ? <&&&> Sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . <&&&> Can you recommend one ? What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? <&&&> Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . <&&&> Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? <&&&> Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . Could you drive me to the bank ? Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? <&&&> I'm going out this Saturday . <&&&> Do you already have a foursome ? <&&&> Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . <&&&> That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? <&&&> We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . <&&&> How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . <&&&> How much does it cost over there ? <&&&> Twilight rates are 21 dollars . <&&&> That's pretty good . Let's do it . <&&&> Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4 Hi , I want to check out . <&&&> Okay . Come with me . <&&&> Can I pay by a credit card ? <&&&> Sorry , you can only pay cash . Hi , Steven . You have finished a wonderful project recently . <&&&> Oh , yeah , A . Thank you for approving my job . What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . <&&&> This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . <&&&> I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . <&&&> Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! Will you have time this Saturday evening to go to the cinema with me ? <&&&> Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement . <&&&> What a pity ! Then how about Sunday ? Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? <&&&> I'm going out this Saturday . <&&&> Do you already have a foursome ? <&&&> Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . <&&&> That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? <&&&> We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . <&&&> How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . Would you show us the menu ? <&&&> Sure . Here you are . <&&&> I'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , I'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards . are your ready to go to the supermarket ? <&&&> yes , are you ? <&&&> I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . <&&&> you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . <&&&> it wasn't cold out this morning . <&&&> well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! <&&&> well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . <&&&> have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? <&&&> it does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . <&&&> that's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . <&&&> ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . <&&&> how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? <&&&> I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . <&&&> maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . <&&&> I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? <&&&> good idea . That will help us to warm up . Look ! Allen has the mike ! And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? <&&&> Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . <&&&> Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? <&&&> No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . <&&&> What's your strong points ? <&&&> Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . <&&&> What do you dislike most about your job ? <&&&> Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . <&&&> What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? <&&&> A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . <&&&> Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? <&&&> Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . <&&&> How do you feel about overtime work ? <&&&> That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . <&&&> What is most important to you in a job ? <&&&> I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . <&&&> Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? <&&&> I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . <&&&> Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? Dahua's Market . How can I help you ? Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? <&&&> Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Do you mind if I sit down ? Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , do you have any rooms available ? <&&&> A single ? <&&&> No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car . <&&&> Please fill out this form , sir . <&&&> Ok ... Here you are . Do you know that song ? <&&&> Which song ? <&&&> The song you hear now . <&&&> No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ? <&&&> Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ? <&&&> No . How about going to karaoke tonight ? Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! <&&&> Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! <&&&> I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . <&&&> Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? <&&&> I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? <&&&> I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . <&&&> Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . <&&&> Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . <&&&> But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? <&&&> Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . <&&&> I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? <&&&> That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . <&&&> Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? <&&&> Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . <&&&> How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? <&&&> That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . <&&&> So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? <&&&> Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . <&&&> Why did they want to found a college ? <&&&> Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . <&&&> Oh , I see . <&&&> Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . <&&&> When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? <&&&> In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . <&&&> It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . <&&&> Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . <&&&> Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . <&&&> Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . <&&&> I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . <&&&> Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . How many people are there in your family ? <&&&> My immediate family is quite small . It ’ s just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . how about you ? <&&&> I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents . Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? <&&&> Two . French and Spanish . Hello , I want to make a reservation for a Qingdao cruise . <&&&> When will you set out ? <&&&> Next week . <&&&> OK . There is one on Wednesday . <&&&> Good ! How much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ? Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there ! <&&&> Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell . <&&&> Yes , he told me . We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference . <&&&> Oh I see , okay . So I heard you got married . Congratulations ! <&&&> Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful . <&&&> That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! <&&&> You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? <&&&> From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? <&&&> Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! <&&&> Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . <&&&> He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! <&&&> She's chic , isn't she ? <&&&> Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . <&&&> It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . <&&&> Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . <&&&> Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . <&&&> I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! <&&&> The gown is quite expensive , believe me . <&&&> So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . <&&&> You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . <&&&> You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . Excuse me , could I have a menu please ? Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . <&&&> Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . <&&&> You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? <&&&> Well , yes .

I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . <&&&> Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... <&&&> The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... <&&&> What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? Hello . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? <&&&> Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you .

There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . <&&&> The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . <&&&> You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? <&&&> It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room .

Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? <&&&> Because they are full-grown .

I can start using the machines . <&&&> Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . <&&&> What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . <&&&> No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . <&&&> I'm ready . <&&&> Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . <&&&> I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . <&&&> Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one .

We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . <&&&> I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie .

They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . <&&&> All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . <&&&> You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? <&&&> That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . <&&&> Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . <&&&> No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? <&&&> Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . <&&&> Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . Good morning , Room Service .

Did you go somewhere ? <&&&> My friends and I just got back from Bali . <&&&> Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? <&&&> Yes , we were lucky .

I have no time to go on a date . <&&&> It is not your mother finding one for you ? <&&&> I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . <&&&> Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . <&&&> You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . <&&&> No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . <&&&> These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . <&&&> Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? <&&&> We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ? <&&&> Well , I'd like to buy a watch . <&&&> Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ? <&&&> Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ... <&&&> How about this one ? It's graceful in style . <&&&> Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> How much is it ? <&&&> 500 dollars , Madam . <&&&> I wonder if it keeps good time . Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes , I'm checking out . <&&&> Can I have your key and room number , please ? <&&&> Room 1419 . Here's my key . <&&&> Here's your bill , sir . Could you please check it ? <&&&> It's all right . Please charge it to my credit card . Everything is OK now , doctor . <&&&> That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much . <&&&> You are welcome , doctor . <&&&> How much do I owe you ? <&&&> The total is 87 dollars . Here is the bill . Excuse me . If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . <&&&> That's right . Let's go into details of it . <&&&> Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . <&&&> Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? <&&&> No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . <&&&> Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . <&&&> I hope you can try to get them to step up production . Joseph , who is that woman ? <&&&> That's Susan . <&&&> What does she do for work ? <&&&> She's a lawyer . <&&&> Is she American ? <&&&> No , but she speaks English fluently . <&&&> She's really tall . Do you know her ? Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time ! Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . <&&&> It is called Energy Collector . Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . <&&&> Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . <&&&> Let's go the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . <&&&> I'd love to try some snacks . <&&&> ( Later ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? <&&&> Kebabs and roast squid . Taxi . <&&&> Yes . Where would you like to go ? Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? <&&&> Sorry , I thought you knew . <&&&> But you should tell me you were in love with her . <&&&> Didn't I ? <&&&> You know you didn't . <&&&> Well , I am telling you now . Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ? <&&&> It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out . Do you have any hats ? <&&&> Yes , we do . I'll show you several kinds . <&&&> I like both of the two hats . Can you give me a discount if I buy both of them She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! <&&&> Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . <&&&> Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . I need to get on another bus , but I have no more money . <&&&> Where'd the rest of your money for the bus go ? <&&&> I spent it on a bag of chips . <&&&> Well , that was an intelligent thing to do . I'm very worried , doctor . I'm afraid that I'm very ill . <&&&> Why do you think so ? <&&&> Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find it very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . <&&&> How do you sleep ? <&&&> Very badly , doctor . <&&&> Are you worried about anything ? <&&&> Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? <&&&> I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . Mom , may I play the card games for a while ? <&&&> Do you ? Dad is in the study . Bell Captain . May I help you ? I want to rent skis and boots . Hi . I just lost my purse when I was shopping on the street . I guess somebody stole it from me . <&&&> Sorry to hear that . Could you tell me what were in your purse ? <&&&> My mobile phone , passport and some cash . <&&&> When did you come to America ? Good morning . I've come here to inquire whether I can get a visa to your country ? <&&&> What do you want to go to US for ? Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? <&&&> I bought it online . <&&&> Really ? Do you often shop online ? <&&&> Yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . <&&&> I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? <&&&> Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . <&&&> Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . <&&&> And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall . <&&&> Well , are there any other advantages ? <&&&> Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . How much tea are you going to order ? <&&&> We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . <&&&> When do you want to deliver the goods ? <&&&> We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . <&&&> I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . <&&&> I can agree to that . <&&&> Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ? How do you get along with your boss ? <&&&> I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . Good morning , Wilson Association . <&&&> This is Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr.Tomas . <&&&> I'm sorry , but Mr.Tomas left here just a few minutes ago . <&&&> I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line was busy . Will he be back soon ? <&&&> I'm afraid not . He is away for the rest of the day . <&&&> Is there any other way I can reach him ? <&&&> I'm afraid not , he has gone out of this town on business . May I take a message ? <&&&> I have a business appointment with him at ten o'clock tomorrow morning , but I'm afraid I can't make it . <&&&> Would you like to make another appointment ? <&&&> Unfortunately , I'm leaving here unexpectedly , and I may be away for several days . Hello . <&&&> Hello , Claire . This is Mick . <&&&> Mick ! Nice to hear from you again . How are you ? <&&&> Fine , thanks . And you ? <&&&> Oh , not so bad .

It isn't necessary . do you have a minute ? <&&&> sure , what would you like to discuss ? <&&&> I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . <&&&> well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? <&&&> I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . <&&&> can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? <&&&> oh , no . not at all . <&&&> are you planning on studying abroad ? <&&&> no , sir . <&&&> have you been given a better offer ? <&&&> Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . <&&&> well , what's the problem then ? <&&&> it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . <&&&> I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . <&&&> really ? I didn't know that would be possible . Can I get some medicine to help me ? <&&&> For your high blood pressure , we have several choices of medications . <&&&> What types of drugs can I try ? <&&&> Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps you with water retention . <&&&> What about side effects from that medication ? <&&&> Most people have no side effects . You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication . <&&&> Do I only need to take that one drug ? Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton . <&&&> Do you know in which area ? <&&&> No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here . <&&&> I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ? <&&&> Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station . Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . <&&&> Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? <&&&> Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . <&&&> Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? <&&&> Right here . <&&&> I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? <&&&> Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . Hey ! What's up ? <&&&> Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . <&&&> Yeah , I've been out of town .

Are you excited about starting work ? <&&&> Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . <&&&> What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ? <&&&> They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ? <&&&> For me , I think starting school was more exciting . Hey , let's eat out tonight . <&&&> What's the occasion ? You won the lottery ? <&&&> No . Just want to relax a little bit .

How do you like waltz ? <&&&> It's very nice , I like it very much . <&&&> May I invite you for the first dance ? <&&&> My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer . <&&&> In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too . <&&&> Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . <&&&> I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . <&&&> Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? <&&&> Yes . And what dances do you like best ? Let's see now . Cut the potatoes into small cubes . I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! <&&&> What are you getting ? <&&&> Well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker . Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling . <&&&> Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . <&&&> Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . <&&&> What makes you say that ? Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . <&&&> Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?

Let's just window shop a little . <&&&> Ok . <&&&> Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . Another glass of beer , will you ? <&&&> Thanks , I'm enough . <&&&> At least one for your trip . Excuse me , Sir , you are not supposed to smoke here . Good morning , may I help you ? <&&&> We'd like to take a tour to Florence . <&&&> That's a beautiful city . When do you want to go there ? Shall we share a taxi ? <&&&> Where are you heading now ? <&&&> I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house . <&&&> Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? <&&&> That's the one . Hi ! I'm Hong lei . What's your name ? <&&&> Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky . <&&&> Hi Ricky . Are you a new student here ? <&&&> Yes , I had my first lesson this morning . Are you a new student too ? <&&&> No , I've been here for six months . <&&&> Six months . That's a long time . <&&&> It's not so long really . What class are you in ? Intermediate or ... ? <&&&> Intermediate Three . And what about you ? <&&&> I'm in Advanced One . Who's your teacher ? <&&&> I can't remember her name , but she's got curly red hair . <&&&> Ah ! Does she wear glasses ? <&&&> Yes , I think so . <&&&> That's probably Anne Wallis . <&&&> Yes that's right . Do you know her ? Is she your teacher too ? <&&&> No . But she taught me last term . How long have you been here ? <&&&> Only a week . <&&&> Wow , not long . Where do you live ? With a family ? <&&&> Well , I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment . I'm looking for somewhere more permanent . Do you know of any good places ? <&&&> Yes . Actually my friend has a spare room in here apartment and she's looking for a flatmate . Would you like her phone number ? Good afternoon , sir . Would you like a tea ? Are you ready to order , sir ? <&&&> Yeah . I have a fancy for some wine tonight . Can you recommend something for me ? <&&&> Our red wine is very famous . I'd suggest you try that . <&&&> All right . What kind of red wine do you serve ? <&&&> Here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . You can have a taste then make your decision then . Here is the wine menu . <&&&> The dry red wine looks quite good . I'd like to try this one . Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? <&&&> Sure , here you are . <&&&> Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? <&&&> Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . <&&&> Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . <&&&> Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . <&&&> Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . <&&&> I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . <&&&> Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' Hi ! What are you watching ? <&&&> It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . <&&&> Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? <&&&> They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . <&&&> Why do they go there ? <&&&> Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . Have you finished washing clothes ? <&&&> I've finished my white clothes . I need to wash the rest . <&&&> Well , when you do your darks , can you wash some of mine too ? Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . <&&&> Like who ? <&&&> Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . What position have you held before ? <&&&> I have been a salesman . <&&&> Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? When will our party be held ? <&&&> Next Wednesday . <&&&> Have you sent out invitations by our party ? <&&&> Yes , I have . <&&&> When ? <&&&> Ten days ago . <&&&> Could Dr.Cole like to attend the party ? <&&&> Yes , he will . You heard who won the election , right ? <&&&> Who was elected ? <&&&> McCain won the election . <&&&> That can ’ t be true ! Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast.Are you tired ? Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process . <&&&> As your realtor , I am here to take care of this process . How much were you planning on offering ? <&&&> I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . <&&&> We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ’ s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . <&&&> That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me . <&&&> The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one . <&&&> When will we know if they accept the offer ? <&&&> The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days . <&&&> Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ? Have you got your invitation yet ? Hello , is this the ABC Company ? May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? <&&&> Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! <&&&> Why are they all in glass boxes ? <&&&> For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . <&&&> So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? <&&&> No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box . <&&&> I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ? <&&&> Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . I don't know if you remember , but with honest every day last year we tided the knot . <&&&> Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget . <&&&> How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you . <&&&> They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . <&&&> You are more beautiful than the roses . <&&&> I don't know how , but I love you more than the day we gotta married . <&&&> Yes , we are match made in heaven . <&&&> I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles , but we survived and here we are . <&&&> Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too .

We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? <&&&> Sure . What's your room number , sir ? <&&&> It's 8736 . Here is my key card . <&&&> A minute , please . It's 6212 yuan all together .

No wonder there are few people . <&&&> Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? <&&&> yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? <&&&> come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! <&&&> when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . <&&&> maybe you have a point . <&&&> make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . <&&&> all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! <&&&> that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . <&&&> oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? <&&&> No , not really . Why do you ask ? <&&&> Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . <&&&> You saw a ghost ? When ? <&&&> It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... <&&&> So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? <&&&> It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... <&&&> So what did you do ? <&&&> I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... <&&&> Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday <&&&> You are welcome , Mr . Sun . <&&&> I really enjoyed meeting with you . Hello , Steven . Can you do me a favor ? <&&&> Sure .

Could you introduce some whitening products for me ? <&&&> Please forgive me just being frankly , madam . You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white . But you have freckles on your face . <&&&> Then what kind of product can fade freckles ? <&&&> I recommend Nisei products . This brand has a face cream which is effective on fading freckles . <&&&> How much is it ? <&&&> 419 yuan .

It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . <&&&> Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? <&&&> No , he's living in an old house in Warton . <&&&> Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? <&&&> That's the one . <&&&> His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? <&&&> He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . <&&&> Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . <&&&> A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . <&&&> Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM's China Headquarters . <&&&> That's true . I got the news yesterday . I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses . <&&&> Oh my gosh , how exciting ! <&&&> Will you come with me and help me choose ? Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? Excuse me , but I'm looking for a gift for my friend . <&&&> Is it a Chinese New Year's gift or a birthday gift ? Hello ? <&&&> Hello , is that Miss Smith ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> This is Mr.Gao . How are you ? <&&&> Not too bad , thanks . And you ? <&&&> Fine . Listen . Are you free on Wednesday night ? I'd like to invite you to dinner . <&&&> I'm terribly sorry , but I've already made arrangements for Wednesday . <&&&> That's a pity . How about Thursday ? <&&&> That would be fine . <&&&> Great . What time would you like to meet ? <&&&> Whenever is suitable for you . I have no plans for that day . Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . <&&&> Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” . <&&&> Ahhhhhhhh <&&&> Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? Would you like to play golf with me ? <&&&> I would like to . but I'm not good at it . Bill , will you be free at noon ? Can I be of any help ? <&&&> I have a fifteen-day vacation and I want to have a trip to England . Is there any route that fits me well ? <&&&> Yes , of course . How about this one ? It's a new route . Would you like to drink some coffee ? <&&&> No , thanks . I have some trouble with my heart , my doctor recommend I to drink less . I want to buy a wallet . <&&&> Here are all the wallets with various designs . How about this one ? It is quite fashionable . <&&&> May I pick it up ? <&&&> Of course . <&&&> Do you have one of better quality ? The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . I need your help , Bob . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . <&&&> Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . <&&&> Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . <&&&> Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . Why don ’ t we go for Teppanyaki tonight ? <&&&> Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza . <&&&> Actually , I haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . Let ’ s do that then . <&&&> Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ? <&&&> If it were up to me , I ’ d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier . Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ? <&&&> Yes , it is . Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton . <&&&> Do you know in which area ? <&&&> No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here . <&&&> I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ? What do you think of this flat ? <&&&> It's not really all that good . The bedroom is a little small for us . Have you heard about the new iPhone ? <&&&> yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? <&&&> I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . <&&&> if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . <&&&> how big is a shuffle iPod ? <&&&> the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . <&&&> how many gigs of music can it hold ? <&&&> I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . <&&&> how much do they cost ? <&&&> not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . <&&&> you're right , that's not bad at all . <&&&> do you have an iPod ? <&&&> I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . How was your trip to America ? I can ’ t wait to retire . <&&&> And then what ? <&&&> And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! <&&&> That sounds boring to me . <&&&> What do you plan on doing after you retire ? <&&&> Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . May I ask what the name is the girl ? <&&&> Which one ? <&&&> The tallest one . <&&&> She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . Wedding rings ! <&&&> Oh , no ... <&&&> Aren't they cool ? I like the settings . <&&&> Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? <&&&> I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . <&&&> Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? Morning , Mom . <&&&> I made a doctor's appointment for you . <&&&> No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor . <&&&> Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school . <&&&> OK . I'll go see the doctor . <&&&> Bundle up . It's wet and rainy out there . Here's some soup . <&&&> Chicken soup again ? Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? How long have you been washing clothes here ? <&&&> I started washing here about three years ago . <&&&> How come ? <&&&> I can wash my clothes for less money here . <&&&> This is my first time washing clothes here . <&&&> What reason are you washing here today ? Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! So John , have you ever been to China before ? These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? <&&&> Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . <&&&> That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . <&&&> Teresa Jones got a boob job . Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? <&&&> Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . <&&&> Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . Hey ! What's up ? Can you tell me something about financial aid ? I want to go house shopping , and I want to know what I can afford to buy . <&&&> There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ? <&&&> I earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year . <&&&> What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ? <&&&> I have been at the job I now have for 2 years , and I have been with the company for 6 years total . <&&&> Do you receive any other income ? <&&&> I own a small rental unit with a partner , and I receive five hundred dollars a month from that unit . <&&&> Do you know what your credit score is ? <&&&> I don ’ t know , but the last time I checked , it was very good ! Do you need help with something ? May I order some cable from you today ? What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? <&&&> Coffee , please . <&&&> So , you also like Coffee ? Hello . Thank you for calling Spend Mart . Hi , Nancy . How are you doing ? <&&&> Hi , Tom . Want a cup of coffee ? <&&&> Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up . <&&&> Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ? <&&&> You mean used cars ? What's the chef's specialty ? <&&&> It's fried sole . Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? <&&&> Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . ' <&&&> Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night . <&&&> Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please . <&&&> Thank you for taking care of it so quickly . Would you please wait this letter to see with the postages ? <&&&> Do you want to sent this letter by ordinary or registered mail ? Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . Don't talk too much , Tom . We are on duty today , we should hurry up . <&&&> OK . <&&&> Tom , your task is to clean the blackboard . <&&&> How about yourself ? <&&&> I'm going to sweep the floor first . <&&&> Daniel , I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard . <&&&> Stand on the chair , Pig Tom .

Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? <&&&> No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . <&&&> Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ? <&&&> One dollar . <&&&> How many stops are there ? What did you say ? <&&&> I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . <&&&> Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . <&&&> Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . Good morning , sir ! Can I help you ? <&&&> Good morning ! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th . What sports do you like to play ? <&&&> I like baseball and basketball . Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days !

Is it a beautiful country ? <&&&> Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? <&&&> Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? <&&&> Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? <&&&> Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? <&&&> Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? <&&&> No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse !

I was wondering if you could help me use the Student Job Center . <&&&> There are many ways ; what kind of job would you like ? <&&&> I want to work in a restaurant . <&&&> Fine ! Will you need part-time or full-time work ? <&&&> I want to work part-time . <&&&> Fine , the two best ways are to use our local listings binders over there or you can use the computers with the Internet job listing sites . See them over there ? <&&&> Yes , I know what to do . <&&&> Well , in addition , you can schedule an appointment with a job counselor on this list . If you would like to do that , sign here , OK ? Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us . <&&&> No , thank you . <&&&> Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you ? I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance . <&&&> Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner . <&&&> But I exercise at the club . And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes . <&&&> That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . <&&&> What's the difference ? <&&&> There isn't much difference . But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner <&&&> And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? <&&&> They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce <&&&> But they aren't as light , right ? <&&&> That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . <&&&> That's what I want.For exercising at the club . I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . <&&&> But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? <&&&> Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? <&&&> I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? <&&&> Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . <&&&> My pleasure . <&&&> I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? <&&&> A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . <&&&> You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . <&&&> Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . <&&&> Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? <&&&> Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line .

I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . <&&&> Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . <&&&> Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . <&&&> You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ?

What kind of novel did you have in mind ? <&&&> I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good . I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment . <&&&> I would be happy to answer any questions you might have . <&&&> My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . <&&&> What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ? <&&&> My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period . <&&&> When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ? <&&&> Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form . <&&&> What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away . Have you got the medicine yet ? <&&&> Yes , I've been given so much , that I simply don't know what to do with it all . <&&&> Well , these are for internal use.You take a packet each time.Four times a day . <&&&> What about these ? Right . Just take off your jacket and shirt . And lie down on that bed over there ... That's right ... Now , just hold up your right arm , will you ? ... Does this hurt ? <&&&> No . <&&&> And this ? <&&&> Yes . . . a bit . . . ouch ! <&&&> And do you feel anything when I do this ? <&&&> Yes , that hurts quite a lot . I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . <&&&> That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . <&&&> But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . <&&&> Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . Are you watching another news report about the war ? <&&&> Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . <&&&> How did this war start ? <&&&> Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . <&&&> Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . <&&&> Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . You know them ?

May I order some cable from you today ? <&&&> Okay , what package would you like to order ? <&&&> I'm not sure of what packages you offer . <&&&> We offer packages with all the movie channels . <&&&> Are there any other packages ? Hi , Is that David ? <&&&> Hi , Jenny . It's David here . <&&&> Hey , what's new ? <&&&> Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me . <&&&> Sorry to hear that . What happened ? <&&&> Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . <&&&> Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . <&&&> What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . <&&&> Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . <&&&> But she lied to me . <&&&> Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? <&&&> Ok , then . <&&&> But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . Come and meet our employees , Mr .

Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . <&&&> You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! <&&&> You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ? Hong , I really need to call back to the UK but I can ’ t afford to pay for the roaming charges . <&&&> Well , why don ’ t you use a local SIM card ? <&&&> Can I do that ? <&&&> Yes . Just go to the convenience store and ask for a SIM card . Then insert it into your phone . Hey , Lily , what are you doing ? <&&&> Waiting for someone . <&&&> You mean the boy you met on MSN ? <&&&> You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . <&&&> You must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! <&&&> I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . <&&&> I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . <&&&> Well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . <&&&> Did you tell him ? <&&&> Yes . He said I'm his dream girl .

What's up ? You look depressed . Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? <&&&> Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ? <&&&> No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? <&&&> Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop . <&&&> I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . <&&&> I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . What do you need ? what sort of music do you like ? Good to see you . Come on in . Hello , Room Reservation Service . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes . This is Mrs.Davinson .

I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . <&&&> How much are you looking to spend ? <&&&> I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . <&&&> Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . <&&&> Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . <&&&> Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! <&&&> Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? You can keep these books for only half a month . <&&&> May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ? My stay is over . Here's the key to my room . <&&&> Thank you .

The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . <&&&> You're joking , right ?

What can I offer you here ? <&&&> I came here to ask for some information . <&&&> Ok . Please go ahead . <&&&> I bought a pair of trousers last year , which I like the best . But this year they don ’ t fit me very well . They ’ re tight in the waist , baggy at the knees . Can you make some alterations ? <&&&> Oh , we are skillful in doing that . You can trust us .

OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . <&&&> Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? <&&&> Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . <&&&> I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? <&&&> Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . <&&&> So how do you intend to do that ? <&&&> OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . <&&&> May I interrupt you for a moment ? <&&&> Go ahead . <&&&> How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? Hi , sir . Come and have a look here . We have all kinds of sweaters . <&&&> I ’ m looking for a sweater for my wife . Tomorrow is her birthday . And I know she needs a woolen sweater . Can you exchange this for US dollars , please ? <&&&> Just fill out this form , will you ? <&&&> OK . Here . <&&&> How would you like it ? <&&&> Five tens , five fives and the rest in ones , please . Excuse me , Professor . I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done . <&&&> What happened that you didn't get it done ? <&&&> I had to watch a football game instead . <&&&> Well , you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day ? <&&&> Yes , I think so . <&&&> Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ? Excuse me.Would you like a drink before your meal ? <&&&> Pardon me ? <&&&> Would you like a drink ? <&&&> Oh , I see . I'll have beer , please . <&&&> OK.Here you are . <&&&> Thank you.How much is it ? <&&&> Well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge . What does it cost to ride this bus ? <&&&> The fare is $ 1.25 . <&&&> Have you been driving buses a long time ? <&&&> I haven't been driving for long — only for a few months . <&&&> Do you like to drive the bus ? Are you sure this is the right restaurant 。 <&&&> Positive 。 May I have your resume , please ? <&&&> Yes , I need a job that can give full play to my skills . You see that chick over there ? <&&&> The one in the red shirt ? <&&&> Yeah . Isn't she hot ? <&&&> She's alright . <&&&> Just alright ? ! ? She's hot ! <&&&> Why don't you go talk to her ? <&&&> You think she's out of my league ? <&&&> Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . <&&&> C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls . <&&&> Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . How can I help you today , Alice ? <&&&> Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship . <&&&> Oh , good . You're an excellent student . I'd be very willing to help you with that . <&&&> Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . <&&&> What kind of scholarship is it ? <&&&> It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . <&&&> Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . <&&&> I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . <&&&> Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it . <&&&> Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . <&&&> Do you have an essay you want to send them ? <&&&> No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . <&&&> What is the question ? <&&&> They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . <&&&> That's a pretty short essay . <&&&> Yes , but I need to write it by next week . <&&&> Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . <&&&> I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . <&&&> Sure . What are they ? <&&&> First , I need a letter of recommendation . <&&&> I'd be happy to write one for you . <&&&> And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . <&&&> What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? <&&&> Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? <&&&> Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . <&&&> I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . Have you got any certificate of technical qualification ? Hi Mary , how's it going ? <&&&> well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . <&&&> terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . <&&&> now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . <&&&> really ? What happened ? <&&&> it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee <&&&> that's pretty harsh . So , are we all behind this new project ? <&&&> I'm in favor of Maggie . <&&&> Ditto , it doesn't look too expensive either . <&&&> That's right , Nigel . I think we can keep cost down . Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . <&&&> I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? <&&&> why not ? I love animals and I love nature . <&&&> You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . <&&&> sounds very interesting .

Do you know how late it is ? <&&&> My fault . I didn't realize what time it was . <&&&> I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook . <&&&> Not really . I'm telling the truth . <&&&> Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? <&&&> This is true , but it must've slipped my mind . <&&&> Regardless , all you had to do was give a call . <&&&> I know . I should've called . Aren ’ t you going to swim ? <&&&> Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? <&&&> You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ?

There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . <&&&> Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . <&&&> Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . What's the matter ? You don't look well . <&&&> I am worried . <&&&> What about ? <&&&> My exam . <&&&> Oh , is that all ? <&&&> I feel very nervous about it . May I help you ? Miss ! <&&&> Yes .

But my English still needs work . <&&&> I want to study Mandarin and international relations . <&&&> Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? <&&&> They teach regular characters . <&&&> I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . <&&&> You just said your English needs work , yes ? <&&&> Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . <&&&> Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . <&&&> You mean you and I ? <&&&> Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . <&&&> That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? <&&&> Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . <&&&> How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ?

Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ? <&&&> The mangoes are on sale today . <&&&> What exactly are mangoes ? <&&&> They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed . <&&&> Is the seed edible ? <&&&> Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it . <&&&> How much does a mango cost ? It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen . <&&&> What size pan were you thinking of ? <&&&> I've already got a small pan . I need a big one . <&&&> Well , this one might work for you . <&&&> Oh , no , that's way too heavy a pan for me . <&&&> Here , lift this aluminum pan . It's the same size . <&&&> Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle . <&&&> Here's a similar aluminum pan . But it has a heat-resistant handle . <&&&> Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it . This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? <&&&> Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! <&&&> Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ?

I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . Excuse me , do you have A tale of Two Cities ? I'd like a copy of it . <&&&> Who is the author ?

I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! <&&&> that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . <&&&> I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . <&&&> what's that ? <&&&> well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . <&&&> that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . <&&&> for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient .

Why didn ’ t she call the police . <&&&> Because it was her husband who beat her . <&&&> It is incredible . What are you reading ? <&&&> It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . <&&&> It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . <&&&> Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . <&&&> Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? <&&&> The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . <&&&> Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? <&&&> It ’ s a difficult choice . The train is a litter faster , but much more expensive . <&&&> We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . <&&&> Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around . Here . Keep the change . Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? <&&&> Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ? <&&&> Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding .

The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . <&&&> Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? <&&&> Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . <&&&> What about restaurants and entertainment ? <&&&> There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey . <&&&> Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? <&&&> There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . <&&&> I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . <&&&> They spend hours there , especially on weekends . <&&&> Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? <&&&> I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? <&&&> Isn ’ t that complicated ? <&&&> No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . <&&&> We ? Do you want to go with me ? <&&&> Sure . I love going to the mall . May I help you find something , or are you just looking ? <&&&> I'm just looking . <&&&> Then take your time , please .

Ok . Let's see it this Saturday . What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . <&&&> I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . <&&&> You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . <&&&> That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . Hello , I ’ d like to speak to Kate . Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . <&&&> Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . <&&&> To me English is a difficult language . <&&&> A second language is always difficult . <&&&> True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . Have you been feeling OK lately ? Is my car ready yet ? <&&&> I don't know , sir . What's the number of your car ? <&&&> It's LF 312 G . <&&&> When did you bring it to us ? <&&&> I bought it here three days ago . <&&&> Ah yes , I remember now . Are you busy next Saturday ? <&&&> No , why ? <&&&> I need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and I reply don't know what to get . Will you come shopping with me ? I would like to order some internet today . Do you have any sales experience ? Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . <&&&> I've said you will enjoy your life here ! <&&&> I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? <&&&> Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . <&&&> My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . <&&&> That's good ! <&&&> Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? Good morning , sir . Do you have a reservation ? Do you sell washing machines ? <&&&> Yes . We ’ re having a special sale on this machine here . <&&&> Is that a Danish machine ? The name looks Danish . Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ? <&&&> Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? We must set 1000 dollars aside each month . Have you seen Harry ? Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ? You don ’ t look so good . <&&&> I feel horrible . I think I picked up a bug . <&&&> Do you know who you got it from ? <&&&> A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there . <&&&> Did you take any cold medication ? <&&&> I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest . <&&&> I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . <&&&> My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . Mr . Wilson . I'm very glad we reached the agreement at last . Now I'd like to propose a toast to the further development of our cooperation . Ah ! No ! Damn it ! <&&&> It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . <&&&> So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . <&&&> Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? <&&&> No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . <&&&> I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . <&&&> I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . <&&&> What are we going to do now ? <&&&> I don't know . I feel like going out . <&&&> I wonder how much of the city is down . <&&&> It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . <&&&> Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . <&&&> Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . <&&&> Thank you for inviting me . I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . <&&&> Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? <&&&> Yep . And I should start planning now . How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? <&&&> I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . How is everything going with your girlfriend ? <&&&> Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! <&&&> Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? Good evening , madam . May I help you ? <&&&> I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? <&&&> Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . <&&&> That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? <&&&> We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . <&&&> What's the regular price ? Hello . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ m here to apply for the job of director that your company posted yesterday . Is it still available ? <&&&> Yes . We ’ ll close this position posting at the end of this month . <&&&> Great . Where can I get an application form ? <&&&> Go to the Human Resource Office , please . You can get it there . <&&&> Where is the Human Resource Office ? <&&&> It ’ s on the first floor , Room 120 . <&&&> Thanks a lot . Excuse me . Can you direct me to the toy department , please ? <&&&> It's on the 7th floor . As you get off the elevator , you'll see it on your left . I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . <&&&> Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . <&&&> What does it come with standard ? <&&&> On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com <&&&> Cruise control ? I don't like that . <&&&> Why not , sir ? <&&&> I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? <&&&> Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . <&&&> I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . <&&&> You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . <&&&> I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? <&&&> No , the sunroof is optional , sir . Do you know which stop we get off at ? <&&&> We still have more to go , I think . Happy Birthday , Mary ! <&&&> Thank you . Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ? <&&&> Speaking . <&&&> Oh , hi Justin . This is Karen Hepburn.We met at Chris and Jim's party . <&&&> Of course . How're you ? <&&&> Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . <&&&> I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday . Are you sure you know where this bus goes ? <&&&> It should go to Altadena . <&&&> What do you mean it should ? What is your greatest strength ? <&&&> I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . Is Jack still staying idle everyday ? Mike ! Look at the floor ! <&&&> What's wrong with it ? <&&&> What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! <&&&> Oh ... <&&&> It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . <&&&> Sorry , love . <&&&> What are you looking for now ? <&&&> My cigarettes . Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ? <&&&> I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt . As you know , I majored in computer programming in the university . I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge . I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world , and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . That ’ s why I applied . <&&&> I see . But have you ever done any work in this field ? <&&&> Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation . <&&&> Why do you plan to change your job ? <&&&> Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough . Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . <&&&> Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . They are playing the wedding march , and I have felt tears . Ah ! No ! Damn it ! <&&&> It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . <&&&> So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . <&&&> Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? <&&&> No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . <&&&> I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so .

I feel like going out . <&&&> I wonder how much of the city is down . <&&&> It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . <&&&> Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . <&&&> Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . <&&&> I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . <&&&> Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? <&&&> I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . <&&&> Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? <&&&> No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . <&&&> So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? <&&&> How many students are in the class ? <&&&> About fourteen . Long time no see ! <&&&> Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met . <&&&> It's nice to see you again . Have you changed jobs ? <&&&> No .

Why ? <&&&> How about a coffee in that cafe ? Hello , can I speak to Alice , please ? <&&&> Hold on , please . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Sorry , but she ’ s out . <&&&> Could you tell her Tom Green called ? Hi , what're you reading ? It's very nice of you to invite me . <&&&> I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? <&&&> Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ? <&&&> Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste . <&&&> Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable . They are very good in colour , flavour , and taste . <&&&> Mr . Liu , would you care for another helping ? <&&&> No more , thank you . I'm quite full . Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? <&&&> No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . We've got a new manager in our department . <&&&> Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? <&&&> Yes , I did . <&&&> I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? <&&&> Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too <&&&> Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? <&&&> Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! <&&&> You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? <&&&> Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . <&&&> What sort of clothes does he wear ? <&&&> A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? <&&&> Perhaps that had something to do with it . <&&&> You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? <&&&> It's possible , isn't it ? <&&&> Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . <&&&> I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US , it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network . <&&&> What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . I finally found an apartment that I want to rent . Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . <&&&> It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . <&&&> Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . <&&&> I'm sorry . What's your name again ? <&&&> Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . <&&&> So Barb ... what do you do ? <&&&> I'm studying medicine . Can you tell me the best way to see the city ? <&&&> Sure , I advise the sightseeing buses . <&&&> Travel by the buses ? That sounds interesting . Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . <&&&> Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? Hello ! <&&&> Is Petti there ? <&&&> I'm sorry , I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . There is no Petti here . Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? <&&&> Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . ' <&&&> Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night . <&&&> Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please . <&&&> Thank you for taking care of it so quickly . <&&&> Sir , when I deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge . <&&&> You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet ! <&&&> I don't care what the best part is . Whatever you say won't change my mind . I'm not buying anything ! <&&&> That stamp you've been looking for is for sale . Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? <&&&> We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . <&&&> Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . <&&&> It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . <&&&> We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? <&&&> We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . <&&&> That sounds very general . <&&&> It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . <&&&> One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? I ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please . <&&&> Certainly . Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here . <&&&> Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend . <&&&> This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . <&&&> Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one . Hello , I have a reservation for a double . <&&&> What's your last name ? <&&&> It's Smith . Here is my driver's license . <&&&> Yes , I do show your reservation . How could you like to pay for the room ? <&&&> I'd like to put it on my VISA . <&&&> Fine . Here is your room key , here is also a map of our hotel . The swimming pool , gym and sauna are all located on first floor . <&&&> Great , is our room ready yet ? When you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , She must have a cow ! oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? <&&&> it's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . <&&&> Cindy , you're so cute . <&&&> she is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? <&&&> I have a little white cat . <&&&> Oh , a cat ? Come on . <&&&> yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . <&&&> but I think they're dull , aren't they ? <&&&> not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . <&&&> well , cats are certainly more independent . <&&&> absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . <&&&> oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? <&&&> yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . Sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ? <&&&> Do you want to buy a new bicycle ? <&&&> Yes , and they have a sale on now . <&&&> What happened to your old one ? <&&&> I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well . I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back . <&&&> Let's go then . <&&&> Look at this mountain bike . It is only £ 330 . Do you like it ? <&&&> I prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive . <&&&> How much is it ? <&&&> The price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount . If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . <&&&> That's right . Let's go into details of it . <&&&> Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . <&&&> Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? <&&&> No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . <&&&> Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . <&&&> I hope you can try to get them to step up production . <&&&> They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . <&&&> If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . <&&&> I'm sorry . <&&&> What's your last word as to the delivery date then ? Oh , here comes a bus ! <&&&> It's here at last ! <&&&> How long have you waited ? What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! <&&&> You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? <&&&> From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? <&&&> Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! <&&&> Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . <&&&> He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! <&&&> She's chic , isn't she ? <&&&> Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . <&&&> It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . <&&&> Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . <&&&> Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . <&&&> I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! <&&&> The gown is quite expensive , believe me . <&&&> So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . <&&&> You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . Mon and I got in another fight , Boris . <&&&> oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ? <&&&> it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . <&&&> I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . <&&&> oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them . <&&&> I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . <&&&> But , Boris , i am not a baby any more . <&&&> well , that's true . <&&&> how about your mother ? I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . <&&&> Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . <&&&> What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? It's my wife's birthday . I need to buy some flowers for her . <&&&> Most women love red roses for their birthday . <&&&> How much will the roses be ? <&&&> You can get a dozen for only $ 20 . <&&&> Now , that's a price that I like . <&&&> You're in luck today because the roses are on sale . <&&&> Okay , I'll take the roses . Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . <&&&> Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? <&&&> That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . <&&&> That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? <&&&> Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . <&&&> How often do you have meetings ? <&&&> You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee <&&&> I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already .

The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . <&&&> do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? <&&&> I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? <&&&> no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . <&&&> where are you from ? <&&&> I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . <&&&> did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? <&&&> most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . <&&&> wow , that must have really been scary . <&&&> actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . <&&&> have you ever experiences a flood ?

What is that ratio exactly ? <&&&> It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ? <&&&> It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . <&&&> Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? <&&&> According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . <&&&> That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . <&&&> What ’ s the next question . I am not sure how to add a class . <&&&> Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? <&&&> I'll bring one next time . <&&&> When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? <&&&> I think I know where it is . <&&&> Across the courtyard on the right is the office . Follow the signs to the correct line . Is that clear ? <&&&> Thank you for your directions . It's clear . <&&&> You can't miss it . Add the class and then come back . We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet . <&&&> That's great . Thank you so much . Would you like me to type it for you ? <&&&> Yes , please . That would be a great help .

There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . <&&&> Stereotypes ? Like what ? <&&&> Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . <&&&> I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . <&&&> Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . <&&&> You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . <&&&> I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . <&&&> Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . Where are we going to visit today ? <&&&> We are going to the national park . <&&&> Really ?

Soup , well , society makes us like this . <&&&> I think you're hallucinating ! What are you talking about ? <&&&> Well , thin is always " in " with the media . <&&&> And your point is ? <&&&> if you aren't thin , you're nobody . <&&&> I agree with you , but I think people are pretty bad , too . <&&&> You lost me . Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ? <&&&> Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things . <&&&> Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this . <&&&> I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them . <&&&> Yes , that happens . <&&&> I brought my transcript from my first year.Here .

Have you been registered yet , sir ? <&&&> No , I haven't been registered . <&&&> Are you a medical or surgical case ? <&&&> I'm a medical case . <&&&> Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? <&&&> Yes , here you are .

There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . <&&&> I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . <&&&> I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . <&&&> No-one really believes gossip columnists . <&&&> I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns .

Good morning Mr Smith . My name is Susan and I am a reporter for the Evening Star . I really need to go shopping . <&&&> What do you need to buy ? <&&&> I need to look for a new bedroom set . <&&&> Where are you going to go look for one ? <&&&> I have absolutely no idea . <&&&> You don't know where you want to look for one ? <&&&> No , I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets . <&&&> Do you want to know where I got mine from ? Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . <&&&> Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . <&&&> I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . <&&&> Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . <&&&> Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? <&&&> History . <&&&> Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your <&&&> Thirty percent ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? <&&&> Yes . It's an excellent system . <&&&> Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? <&&&> Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . <&&&> I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . <&&&> I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . <&&&> What ? Are you serious ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> But nobody uses Macintosh ! <&&&> That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma <&&&> Yes , I'm from Taiwan . <&&&> Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . <&&&> But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . <&&&> There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple . <&&&> Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . <&&&> No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . <&&&> Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? <&&&> I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . <&&&> Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . <&&&> It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? <&&&> You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . <&&&> Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! Hello ? This is Steven . I'd like to speak to Mr . Brown , please . <&&&> I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . <&&&> Then what time do you think he will be in ? <&&&> I suppose he won't come back until 6 p . m . By the way , do you want to call later , or would you like to leave a message ? <&&&> I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he returns . He has my number . Hello , Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today . <&&&> Yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon . <&&&> I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . <&&&> Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? <&&&> I'm very sorry . But Mr . Stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . Mary ? Are you still there ? <&&&> Yes . What do you want ? That radio's pretty loud . Could you turn it down , please ? <&&&> Sorry . Was I disturbing you ? <&&&> Yes . And something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking . And how will you be paying for your room , Ms White ? <&&&> By credit card . <&&&> Both rooms on the same card ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Your card number please ? <&&&> 4434 1234 5678 9902 . <&&&> Double one , zero two ? <&&&> No , double nine zero two . <&&&> 4434 1234 5678 9902 ? <&&&> That's right . <&&&> And the expiry date ? <&&&> Eleven , ... So how did I do ? What did you do over the weekend ? <&&&> I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . <&&&> Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? <&&&> It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . <&&&> Like what ? <&&&> Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . <&&&> What else can we do to protect the environment ? <&&&> If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . <&&&> How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? <&&&> Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . <&&&> What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? <&&&> I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . Have you had enough time to look over the menu ? <&&&> Yes , we are almost ready to order . <&&&> Let me remind you of the specials of the day , which are posted on the board . <&&&> Oh , that all sounds so good !

I think I'm going to go to the market today . <&&&> Do we need food ? <&&&> Yeah , I think so . <&&&> What are you going to get ? <&&&> I'm not sure what we need . <&&&> Maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator . <&&&> Could you do it for me , and write out a list of things that we need ? <&&&> Just get the basics . <&&&> Like what ? <&&&> You know . Get some eggs , milk , and bread . <&&&> Just go and make a list for me , please . Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . <&&&> Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . <&&&> Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? <&&&> That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . <&&&> So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? <&&&> Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health . <&&&> I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ? <&&&> For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise . <&&&> I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ? Excuse me . Where can I buy some cigarettes ? What can I do for you ? <&&&> Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation . <&&&> You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? <&&&> I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . <&&&> What do you think is the biggest change ? <&&&> Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . <&&&> I would need to check on that . Where is the fundraiser ? <&&&> It will be at the beach by the pier . <&&&> What day will you need it for ? <&&&> We will only be needing it for Sunday . <&&&> Maybe that could work . I need to know who will be driving it . These are new arrivals . <&&&> Let me have a look . <&&&> Try them if you like . <&&&> I like the fabric , but I don ’ t like the style . <&&&> What about that one over there ? Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! <&&&> What ? What did you buy ? <&&&> It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! <&&&> What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? <&&&> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . <&&&> And ? <&&&> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . <&&&> And it's a brick ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? <&&&> I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . <&&&> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . <&&&> Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . Good morning , what can I do for you ? <&&&> I want to buy a car to facilitate my life . But I don't have enough money . Could you supply a loan to me ? <&&&> Oh , I see .

But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . <&&&> My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house . <&&&> Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis <&&&> Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent ! <&&&> My aunts and uncles are all teachers . <&&&> You are so lucky ! <&&&> I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . <&&&> That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . <&&&> I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . <&&&> 800 books ? I'm impressed ! Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes . <&&&> Sorry , turkey . I have already got dibs on the TV for tonight , remember ? And I'm watching ' Disco Fever ' on channel 6 . <&&&> Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ... <&&&> Hey , what's wrong with the TV ? <&&&> I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube . <&&&> Looks like the TV wins that argument . Good game ? <&&&> Not bad . But too hot for me today . <&&&> Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? <&&&> Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? <&&&> Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . What can I do for you today ? <&&&> I need to return a book . Is there a bus in Altadena that'll take me to downtown LA ? <&&&> The 486 . <&&&> The 486 really goes downtown ? <&&&> Yes , it does . <&&&> How long is the bus ride ? <&&&> It's about forty-five minutes to an hour . <&&&> Is that right ? <&&&> Yeah , it's not that long of a trip . What happened ? I'm looking for some blush . Do you still have some in peach rose ? <&&&> Oh , yes , that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left . <&&&> Great , I'll take one . <&&&> Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any Elizabeth Arden products , you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick , mascara and two shades of white shadow . <&&&> Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ? <&&&> I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? Do you think they two will get married ? <&&&> You can count on it . <&&&> I think so.Yes , they get along so well . <&&&> I like him.He ' s good for her . Could I get some beef ? <&&&> What kind of beef would you like to get ? <&&&> Ground beef would be fine . Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? <&&&> Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . <&&&> I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . <&&&> I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . <&&&> What's your proposal then ? <&&&> I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . <&&&> We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? <&&&> As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . <&&&> 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . <&&&> That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . <&&&> What's your counter-offer then ? <&&&> To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . <&&&> 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . <&&&> If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . <&&&> How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . <&&&> 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . I need to eat something . <&&&> You just ate . <&&&> I know , but I'm hungry again . <&&&> There's no food left from dinner . <&&&> I think I'm going to go make myself a snack . <&&&> Do you know what kind of snack that you want ? <&&&> I'm not exactly sure . <&&&> Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something ? <&&&> I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make . <&&&> A PB & J is pretty easy to make . <&&&> I'm going to do that . Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . <&&&> Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? <&&&> Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? <&&&> Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . <&&&> The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? <&&&> Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . <&&&> When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . What would you like to drink ? <&&&> I feel like a cup of black tea . <&&&> Wouldn't you like something to eat ? Can you believe that Obama is our new President ? <&&&> I ’ m so happy about that . <&&&> Did you vote for him ? <&&&> I sure did . How about you ? <&&&> I voted for him . <&&&> I have complete confidence in our new President . Welcome to NO Bank . It's Mr Zu , isn't it ? <&&&> Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . <&&&> How's Mrs Zu doing these days ? <&&&> She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . <&&&> Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... <&&&> I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . <&&&> Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . <&&&> Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . We've got a new manager in our department . <&&&> Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? <&&&> Yes , I did . Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ? <&&&> Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower . <&&&> Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ? <&&&> You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . <&&&> Are there many things online ? <&&&> Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! <&&&> Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ? Good Morning.What can I do for you ? <&&&> Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist . <&&&> Do you have a registration card ? <&&&> No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist . <&&&> Then you need to register as a new patient.Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number . Hello sir , how may I help you ? <&&&> I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? <&&&> He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . <&&&> Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . <&&&> When did you start worrying about your weight ? You taught at a local school for a year , right ? <&&&> Yes , I was there as an English teacher . <&&&> Did you enjoy yourself there ? <&&&> Sure . I was fond of those lovely children <&&&> So why did you decide to resign ? I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! <&&&> Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . <&&&> But it ’ s so old . <&&&> Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? <&&&> No , not at all . <&&&> First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . <&&&> I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? <&&&> It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . <&&&> Why does he want to do that ? <&&&> Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . <&&&> Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? <&&&> No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . <&&&> I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . <&&&> So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? <&&&> There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! <&&&> That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . <&&&> We have some fresh red roses . <&&&> How much are the roses ? <&&&> Twenty dollars per dozen . <&&&> That sounds like a good deal . <&&&> Yes , that is today's sale price . Good.Now what kind of job do you want ? Mr.Wilson ? <&&&> I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory . I like your new skirt . <&&&> Do you think it fits me ? <&&&> Yes . It looks terrific ! how's your new job going ? <&&&> really well , thanks . <&&&> how are you finding your new boss ? <&&&> she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . <&&&> would you rather have her or your old boss back ? <&&&> she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . May I try this on ? <&&&> Sure . The color is perfect for you . Have you ever been to Britain ? Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . <&&&> He spoke evil behind his back . <&&&> How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? How long have you been washing clothes here ? <&&&> I started washing here about three years ago . <&&&> How come ? <&&&> I can wash my clothes for less money here . <&&&> This is my first time washing clothes here . <&&&> What reason are you washing here today ? <&&&> I can't wash at home because my machine is broken . <&&&> Go and get it repaired . <&&&> That'll cost too much . <&&&> Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while ? Should I go now ? <&&&> Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas . <&&&> Nothing is happening ! Can I help you ? How are you doing ? <&&&> Everything ’ s fine with me . <&&&> What can I do for you today ? <&&&> Is it possible for me to view the apartment today ? <&&&> Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today . <&&&> Why can ’ t I view it today ? <&&&> You ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment . <&&&> I understand . May I make an appointment then ? <&&&> How does this Friday sound ? <&&&> Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect . <&&&> That will be fine . Would you like to stretch your legs ? <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Let's get a soft drink . <&&&> Do we have enough time ? <&&&> Yes , we do . <&&&> The performance is excellent . <&&&> It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . <&&&> I couldn't agree more . <&&&> Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? I want to know how to buy something from this machine . <&&&> Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ? <&&&> I want to buy one of those snack things . <&&&> Are you ready to go ? It's snowing outside . <&&&> Oh , how could it be ? <&&&> Let's go out and have a look . <&&&> OK . Wait a minute . <&&&> Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . <&&&> Yes . It's really snowing . <&&&> I love winter , I love snow . <&&&> But don't you think it's a little too cold ? Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ? <&&&> Yes , she is . <&&&> Does she teach Chinese ? <&&&> No , she is an English teacher . <&&&> And who ’ s the man in the green beside her ? I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . <&&&> Oh , that ’ s alright . We're leaving now . <&&&> Here's your bill . <&&&> Right . And would you please forward our mail to this address ? <&&&> Certainly . <&&&> Thank you . Goodbye . Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . <&&&> It is in mine too . The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . <&&&> What methods do you use to conserve water ? <&&&> Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . <&&&> I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . <&&&> Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . <&&&> We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . <&&&> The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to return these slacks . <&&&> Alright . Do you have your receipt ? <&&&> Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week . <&&&> And why are you returning them ? <&&&> I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match . <&&&> I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . <&&&> Yes , they were thirty percent off . <&&&> I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . <&&&> I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before . <&&&> I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . <&&&> I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here . Can you make an exception this time ? Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . Good afternoon , how can I help ? <&&&> Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything ? <&&&> Of course .

Excuse me , ma'am , can I help you find anything ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to buy a pair of dress shoes . <&&&> What size do you wear ? <&&&> Ten and a half . <&&&> How about this pair ? <&&&> No , I don't like black . What have you got in brown ? Hello , I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning . <&&&> Of course . When would you like the call ? Hi , my name is Ted , what ’ s yours ? <&&&> What ? <&&&> I said , I ’ m Ted , who are you ? Oh . Have you finished listing your study preferences ? <&&&> Yes , I have . <&&&> Good .

Kelly ? <&&&> Yes , it's me . <&&&> Do you have a cold ? <&&&> No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . <&&&> Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ?

Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? <&&&> Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? <&&&> Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . <&&&> What have you been doing ? <&&&> I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . <&&&> Really ? Good luck for them . <&&&> Thanks . And how are your parents ? This is the last of the milk . <&&&> I know . I intent to go to the store today . <&&&> Would you get some that new cereal we saw advertise on TV . <&&&> Which one ? <&&&> You know . The one with the silly art about how advisements have jump up and down . <&&&> Oh , you mean kikois . <&&&> Yeah , That ’ s the one . Would you mind taking your feet off the table , Mike ? <&&&> Not at all . But I've found satisfaction in it ! <&&&> Do you put your feet on your own table ? Waitress ! My bill for today's lunch , please . <&&&> OK , sir . <&&&> How much do I owe ? What kind of document is an invoice ? <&&&> It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . <&&&> How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? <&&&> Four .

Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . <&&&> I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . <&&&> They spend hours there , especially on weekends . <&&&> Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? <&&&> I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? <&&&> Isn't that complicated ? Why are you in such a hurry ? <&&&> I should finish it as soon as possible . <&&&> Don't worry , do it step by step <&&&> Why can I learn it ? Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . <&&&> Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . <&&&> OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? <&&&> Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . <&&&> Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . <&&&> Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? <&&&> No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . <&&&> Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . <&&&> Here you are . Judy , what do you think of the new general manager ? <&&&> He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me . <&&&> I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him . <&&&> I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way . What do you feel like eating this morning ? <&&&> I usually just have a bowl of cereal . <&&&> The most important meal of the day is breakfast . How may I help you ? <&&&> I couldn ’ t find the book I was looking for . <&&&> Have you checked the database ? <&&&> I checked . <&&&> Was it on the shelf ?

Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? <&&&> I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . <&&&> No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? <&&&> I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! <&&&> What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? <&&&> It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? <&&&> January 5th . <&&&> Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! <&&&> That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . <&&&> No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . <&&&> Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? The car isn't running smoothly . I'd like to have a look at it . <&&&> What's the matter with it ? <&&&> I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here . Hi ! I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning . <&&&> What time do you want the call ? <&&&> I need two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen . <&&&> We can certainly do that . Expect a call from us at 7 o'colock and then again at 7 fifteen . Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? <&&&> I'd love to . oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . <&&&> Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? <&&&> yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? <&&&> come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! <&&&> when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . <&&&> maybe you have a point . How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ? <&&&> You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 . <&&&> In what ? <&&&> In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? <&&&> Jake just broke up with me . <&&&> I'm sorry . When did this happen ? I ’ m ready to settle the bill . <&&&> I hope you enjoyed your stay . <&&&> Definitely ! Very relaxing . Hello . Overseas operator . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like to make a collect call to Japan . <&&&> Your name , please ? <&&&> It's Helen Kent . <&&&> Who would you like to talk to ? <&&&> I'd like to talk to Mr . Edna Kent . Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? <&&&> My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . What about you ? <&&&> Well , I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? <&&&> For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share . Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? <&&&> I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning <&&&> Does that mean studying all the time ? <&&&> I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . <&&&> Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . <&&&> You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts Front desk . May I help you ? <&&&> I'm going to check out tomorrow but will be back in a week's time . Can I leave my luggage here ? Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? <&&&> Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? <&&&> Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . <&&&> That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . <&&&> Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? <&&&> When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . <&&&> I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? <&&&> Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . <&&&> Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . Excuse me . Could you give me some directions ? <&&&> What are you looking for ? <&&&> A gas station . My car ran out of gas two blocks back . <&&&> Walk straight ahead until you come to the second traffic light . Then turn right . What happened to your car ? <&&&> A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car . <&&&> Are they going to pay you for the damages ? <&&&> They're saying it was already there . <&&&> What the hell . That doesn't make sense . What are you going to do ? <&&&> I have to go to court . A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there . <&&&> That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . <&&&> I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars . I ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please . <&&&> Certainly . Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here . <&&&> Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend . <&&&> This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . <&&&> Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . <&&&> Ok , so can I say , " This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . <&&&> That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . Do you have a reservation , sir ? <&&&> No , I am afraid we don't . <&&&> I'm sorry . The restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour .

Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . <&&&> The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . <&&&> But we need the exact time . What time ? I just love your hair that way . <&&&> Thanks . <&&&> Where did you have it done ? <&&&> My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? <&&&> Just yesterday .

Merry Christmas ! <&&&> Huh ? <&&&> I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? <&&&> It is ? Oh , that's nice . <&&&> Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? <&&&> Actually , I'd forgotten about it . <&&&> Forgotten about it ? How could you ? <&&&> Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . Hi , I ’ m Cindy , the office clerk . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Hi , I ’ m Henry Wilson from number 37 . Hello , John . How are you ? <&&&> I'm fine , thanks . And you ? <&&&> Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? <&&&> Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? <&&&> Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . <&&&> What have you been doing ? Are you going to eat anything with your sandwich ? I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . <&&&> Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . <&&&> What does it come with standard ? <&&&> On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com <&&&> Cruise control ? I don't like that . <&&&> Why not , sir ? <&&&> I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? <&&&> Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . <&&&> I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . <&&&> You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . <&&&> I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? <&&&> No , the sunroof is optional , sir . <&&&> I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . <&&&> Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August.If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . <&&&> That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? <&&&> We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . <&&&> My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . <&&&> I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? <&&&> Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? <&&&> Yes , you can.That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . What are you doing ? Cool camera . What are its features ? <&&&> It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient . May I help you ? <&&&> I have a problem . <&&&> What ’ s your problem ? <&&&> I owe fees , but a bank statement never came in the mail about it . <&&&> I apologize for the inconvenience . How was your holiday to Cyprus ? <&&&> It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home . <&&&> Did you happen to meet someone ? <&&&> How did you know ? <&&&> You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ? <&&&> His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there . <&&&> Was it love at first sight ? <&&&> Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went . <&&&> And ? <&&&> Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . Hello ! <&&&> Is that the box-office ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please . <&&&> Just a minute please . Oh , I'm sorry , all the tickets for tonight have been sold out . Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ? <&&&> Of course , Mr . Green . <&&&> Can you print it out before 12 o'clock ? I need it this afternoon . Oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . <&&&> Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? <&&&> Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? <&&&> Come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at it , it's beautiful ! <&&&> When you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . <&&&> Maybe you have a point . <&&&> Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . I am sorry for damaging your car , sir . <&&&> Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies . <&&&> The car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it ? <&&&> Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation . <&&&> There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ? <&&&> Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor . <&&&> That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space . <&&&> Have you taken this to the property management , yet ? <&&&> No . but I'm gonna . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking . Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? <&&&> Yeah , I just got back this morning . <&&&> That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? <&&&> Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . <&&&> Did you take any pictures ? <&&&> Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ? My doctor says that I need a blood test . <&&&> I can help you with that . Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . <&&&> What are you taking my blood for ? <&&&> Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count . <&&&> What information does that give him ? <&&&> If your white blood cell count is off , it could signal an infection somewhere in your body . Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? <&&&> I'm just watching some television . <&&&> I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . <&&&> Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? <&&&> I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . <&&&> That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? <&&&> That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . <&&&> I like to play the piano for fun . <&&&> Yeah . That can be a good hobby . <&&&> Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . Sorry to bother you so early . There's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but I thought I'd ask you first . <&&&> That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it . Have you ever played Making ? <&&&> Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . <&&&> Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . <&&&> Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . When is the next train to New York City ? <&&&> Let me see ... the train to New York City ... here it is ... daily except Sunday at 10 thirty , 12 twenty and 15 ten . <&&&> Aren't there any trains before 10 thirty ? <&&&> Sorry , not before 10 thirty . <&&&> Then one to New York at 10 thirty . <&&&> One way or round trip ? <&&&> One way . <&&&> A soft seat or hard one ? <&&&> How much is a soft ? <&&&> $ 15 . And for a hard one , only $ 6 . What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? are you ready for the meeting ? <&&&> yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? <&&&> it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . <&&&> that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . <&&&> thanks a lot . <&&&> how's your assistant manager getting on ? <&&&> well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . <&&&> what seems to be the problem ? <&&&> well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . <&&&> if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? <&&&> to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . <&&&> I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . <&&&> I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . <&&&> there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . My dear , it's five flights up ! Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ? <&&&> Sure , let's take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . <&&&> Thanks . What does she do ? <&&&> She works as a teller in a bank . Excuse me , ma'am , can I help you find anything ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to buy a pair of dress shoes . <&&&> What size do you wear ? <&&&> Ten and a half . <&&&> How about this pair ? <&&&> No , I don't like black . What have you got in brown ? <&&&> How about these ? <&&&> Oh , Lord , no . Those are ugly . What else do you have ? <&&&> Well , there's this pair . I may go grocery shopping later . <&&&> We need to get food ? <&&&> I don't think we have any food . <&&&> What are you going to buy ? <&&&> What food are we out of ? Do you have a foreign tour ? <&&&> Yes , where do you want to go ? <&&&> Sydney . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . <&&&> Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . <&&&> I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . <&&&> Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . <&&&> Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? Good morning . May I speak to Mr . Black , please ? <&&&> Speaking . <&&&> This is the Front Desk . I'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . We would like to request you to change your room . We are very sorry for the inconvenience . <&&&> 0K . Well , I suppose I have no choice . What do you want me to do ? <&&&> What time is the most convenient for you to change rooms , sir ? <&&&> I'm going out in about half an hour . <&&&> What time will you be back ? <&&&> Oh , around seven o'clock , I suppose . Good afternoon , Miss Tao . Please sit down . <&&&> Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Thank you very much . <&&&> I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind . <&&&> As you please . I ’ m ready . <&&&> The first is why you choose our company ? <&&&> I think yours is a well-known advertising company , so I ’ m sure to get opportunities to display my talent in advertisement . <&&&> Why do you want to quit your present company ? <&&&> Well , the company has some financial problems . People there are all thinking of quitting . <&&&> Well , when do you think you can come over to work ? <&&&> One week after I have submitted my resignation paper . <&&&> When you start to work , I ’ ll give you $ 3,000 a month . that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up . <&&&> it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . <&&&> I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? <&&&> I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . Look , Jimmy's report came today . <&&&> Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? Is everything ready for Billy ’ s birthday party ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ? <&&&> Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too . <&&&> Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ? <&&&> I ’ m sure of that . There ’ s enough food here to feed an army ! Good morning ! The Inland hotel . How may I help you ? could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? <&&&> sure . <&&&> first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? <&&&> well , you are a very hard-worker . <&&&> I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . <&&&> there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? <&&&> I could really use a 5 % rise . <&&&> that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . <&&&> listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . <&&&> that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . <&&&> that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? <&&&> of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . It's hot today , shall we go for a dip at the beach ? <&&&> That's a good idea . Let's bring our trunks and towels . <&&&> Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? <&&&> I'd prefer the pool . <&&&> OK . Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room . I'm hungry . <&&&> You already ate . <&&&> It wasn't enough , because I'm hungry again . <&&&> There's nothing left from dinner . <&&&> I'm going to get a snack . <&&&> What kind of snack are you going to make ? <&&&> I don't know . <&&&> You can always make a sandwich . <&&&> I don't know what kind of sandwich I want . <&&&> Just make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? <&&&> I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . <&&&> That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? <&&&> Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . <&&&> What did it say about you then ? Excuse me , Richard ? Are you busy at the moment ? <&&&> Not really , Betty . What do you need ? Hello , Who's that speaking ? <&&&> I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> Is there any furniture in it ? <&&&> Yes , It's fully furnished . <&&&> What's the rent for a year ? <&&&> 15,000 yuan , including water , but not electricity and gas . <&&&> Where is it located ? <&&&> It's in the International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes'walk from the nearest subway station . <&&&> That's great . But can't you make the rent cheaper , Let's see , 12,000 yuan ? <&&&> The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ? <&&&> OK . I will be free tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . See you . How time flies ! <&&&> May and Danny have already grown up . <&&&> I can still remember our first date . You look upset.What ' s wrong ? <&&&> Nothing . It's just one of those days . Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done . <&&&> Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus . <&&&> I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . <&&&> Why don't you talk to your boss about it ? If you talk to him , he will surely understand . What do we need for the barbecue ? Alison , would you like to have some more ? <&&&> No thanks . I've had enough . <&&&> Actually you haven't had much . <&&&> To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . <&&&> That sounds ridiculous . Why ? Did you working in a similar position before ? <&&&> Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . <&&&> Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ? <&&&> Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . <&&&> If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? <&&&> I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . <&&&> Are you able to operate the telex ? <&&&> Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . <&&&> Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ? <&&&> When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . <&&&> If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently . Mr . : For tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . Then do exercises one through ten on page 21 . <&&&> Do we have to type out our homework ? <&&&> Mr . : No . You only do that when you write reports . You won't believe what just happened . <&&&> What ? <&&&> I went down to change some money , right ? <&&&> Yes . We need some . How much did you change ? <&&&> I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . <&&&> Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? <&&&> Not today . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? <&&&> Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ? <&&&> It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . <&&&> I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? <&&&> She made another white crack about my clothes . <&&&> Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? <&&&> Of course , I am sure . <&&&> You shall go easy on her . she is new here . <&&&> Just how am I supposed to do that ? <&&&> You shall just take it in surprise . <&&&> I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons . <&&&> Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? <&&&> I am not . she is no picnic . Jenny , do you want to go to see a movie ? <&&&> What's on tonight ? <&&&> I want to see ' Click . ' <&&&> Who is in this movie ? What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? <&&&> I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? <&&&> I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . <&&&> I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . <&&&> Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! <&&&> Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . <&&&> In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . <&&&> That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? <&&&> No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? <&&&> Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . <&&&> Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . Where is that ? <&&&> Take me to the airport , please . I've been so stressed these days . <&&&> What's the matter ? Are you OK ? <&&&> I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . <&&&> Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . <&&&> And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . <&&&> You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . <&&&> OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? <&&&> In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! <&&&> OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? <&&&> Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . <&&&> Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . <&&&> But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! I ’ m from Channel 5 News . <&&&> How ’ s it going ? <&&&> I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions . <&&&> Ask away . <&&&> First of all , did you vote today ? <&&&> I already voted . <&&&> Who did you vote for ? <&&&> I ’ m not going to tell you . Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thought . <&&&> But I ... I don't agree with that , because computers weaken kids ' ability to think , because kids don't learn basic skills . Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? <&&&> No , thanks . I'm just looking . I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . Hey man , you hit my car . <&&&> I really didn't mean to . <&&&> It doesn't matter , because you damaged my car . <&&&> It looks okay to me . <&&&> Look what you did to my rear bumper . <&&&> What's wrong with it ? <&&&> My bumper is smashed in . Employees in this company have to have a good command of English . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? <&&&> Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English . <&&&> Well , then , please tell me about your English education . <&&&> I have been studying English since junior high school . And I majored in English in college . <&&&> I see , do you speak any other languages ? We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? <&&&> Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . <&&&> But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... My wife is sick , so I have to cancel a reservation I made . <&&&> If you'll just give me your name , phone , and date of visit , I can cancel your reservation . <&&&> I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234 , April ninth to the fifteenth . Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! <&&&> It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . <&&&> You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! <&&&> Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? <&&&> Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? <&&&> Is today OK ? <&&&> Sorry , I can't go today . <&&&> How about tomorrow night ? <&&&> Ok . What time ? Good morning , can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to check out . <&&&> Yes , of course sir . What's your name and your room number , PLS ? <&&&> Jack Remington , room 1408 . <&&&> Ok , here is your bill , Mr . Remington . <&&&> Which of these is my bill ? What a hot day ! <&&&> Yes , summer is coming . <&&&> Where are you going this summer vacation ? good morning ! <&&&> good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? <&&&> I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! <&&&> that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . <&&&> I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . <&&&> what's that ? <&&&> well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . Did you vote yesterday ? <&&&> I sure did ! Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . <&&&> Why would that be funny ? <&&&> Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . <&&&> I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . <&&&> What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . <&&&> Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . <&&&> What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . <&&&> Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? <&&&> Yes , here you go . <&&&> Will you be checking any bags today . <&&&> Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . <&&&> I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . <&&&> What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! <&&&> I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . I need some more amenities , please . <&&&> I'm not sure I'm following you , sir . <&&&> Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo . <&&&> Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ? <&&&> No , I'm not even halfway through my supply . <&&&> I'm losing you , sir . What's the problem ? <&&&> What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ? <&&&> Okay , I got it . You're collecting souvenirs ! <&&&> There you go . My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs . <&&&> Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? It's loaded with all kinds of items . Mary , today a man from an intermediary gave me a call . <&&&> What did he say ? <&&&> He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job . <&&&> What kind of intermediary is it ? <&&&> It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses . <&&&> What job did he recommend to you ? <&&&> It's on telemarketing . Doctor , what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be ? <&&&> You need to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods . <&&&> Sometimes I don ’ t know what the best foods are . <&&&> Fresh fruits and vegetables are important , along with protein and whole grains . <&&&> What things should I avoid ? I just love your hair that way . <&&&> Thanks . <&&&> Where did you have it done ? Excuse me , sir . I've made a tough decision and here is my resignation . <&&&> I am sorry to hear that . Why do you want to quit ? <&&&> I'm sorry to bring up my resignation at this moment , but I've decided to study abroad . What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . <&&&> Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! <&&&> I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . <&&&> Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! <&&&> Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . <&&&> An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . <&&&> Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . <&&&> GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? <&&&> Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts <&&&> Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? I'd like to rent a car . <&&&> May I see your driver's license , please ? <&&&> Here is my international driver's license . What kinds of cars do you have ? <&&&> We have Honda , Citroen and Toyota .

Do you want insurance ? <&&&> Full coverage , please . <&&&> That's an extra 10 euro a day . Did you see the woman that just left my office ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . <&&&> But it's the style now . <&&&> I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . <&&&> Of course . <&&&> Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . <&&&> Why is that ? <&&&> Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . <&&&> Hackneyed theme ! <&&&> What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? <&&&> Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! <&&&> Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! <&&&> Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? <&&&> Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . <&&&> And then what did happen ? <&&&> Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . <&&&> Interesting !

Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ? <&&&> I can do either one . You really look familiar . <&&&> Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ? <&&&> My name is Phillip Hammer . I think we are related . Who is your dad ? <&&&> Jacob Hammer . He is originally from Holland . I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . <&&&> Have you ever been to America ? Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me . I love your bracelet .

Is it white gold or silver ? <&&&> It's white gold . <&&&> Where did you buy it ? <&&&> My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . <&&&> That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? How can I help you today , Sir ? <&&&> I set up the Personal Wealth Management Service with you , but I'm going to be travelling overseas . I'm not quite sure what I should do . I mean is it possible to still use the service ? You got a letter in the mail . <&&&> Give it to me . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . <&&&> What does it say ? <&&&> I ’ Ve been accepted ! I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . <&&&> Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . <&&&> What does it come with standard ? <&&&> On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com <&&&> Cruise control ? I don't like that . <&&&> Why not , sir ? <&&&> I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? <&&&> Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . <&&&> I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . <&&&> You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . <&&&> I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? <&&&> No , the sunroof is optional , sir . <&&&> I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . <&&&> Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August.If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . <&&&> That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? Good evening , sir . Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . <&&&> Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . <&&&> Thank you . Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! <&&&> You have any idea why ? Could you do me a favor ? <&&&> Sure . What is it ? <&&&> Could you run over to the store ? We need a few things . <&&&> All right .

I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . <&&&> certainly . For how many people ? <&&&> we ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? <&&&> I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ? <&&&> about 7:30 . Sorry , sir . I came late because I had to send for the doctor for my grandfather . <&&&> I do sympathize with you , I assure you . <&&&> Thank you , sir . Would you show me some table-cloths ? <&&&> Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) <&&&> How much is it ? <&&&> A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan . Hello , may I help you ? <&&&> Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent . <&&&> Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet . <&&&> A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for . <&&&> Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK . <&&&> That sounds just wonderful to us . <&&&> When do you want to move in ? I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ? <&&&> What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago . <&&&> I know , but I ’ m really tired . My stomach feels funny . <&&&> What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? <&&&> I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . <&&&> Then when did you go to sleep ? <&&&> About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . <&&&> When ? <&&&> About 2 o ’ clock . <&&&> Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? <&&&> You did , but I can ’ t help it . <&&&> This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? Can you make the tea , Sam ? <&&&> Yes , of course I can , Penny . Is there any water in this kettle ? <&&&> Yes , there is . Show me the photos of the latest hair styles , will you ? <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> This one will suit me best.What do you think ? <&&&> I'm sure you'll look grand when it's done.Would you like to have a shampoo after a while ? <&&&> No , thank you . <&&&> How about oil or spray ? Do you have much experience with kids ? <&&&> Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . <&&&> To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . <&&&> I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . <&&&> What about your mother ? Did she help you ? <&&&> Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people . <&&&> Who ’ s that boy ? <&&&> Where ? <&&&> The one next to the telephone . <&&&> I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ? Do you mind if I ask you a question ? <&&&> No , not at all . Go ahead . <&&&> What do you do in order to improve your English ? <&&&> I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . <&&&> It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? <&&&> Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . Look at the catalogue , John . I think I want to get this red blouse <&&&> Don't you have one like this in blue ? <&&&> Yah , but it doesn't have a red one . what did you do over the weekend ? <&&&> I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . <&&&> do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? <&&&> it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . <&&&> like what ? <&&&> well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . <&&&> what else can we do to protect the environment ? <&&&> if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . <&&&> how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . how is your house hunting going ? <&&&> not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . <&&&> how much are you looking to spend ? <&&&> I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . <&&&> looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . <&&&> really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . <&&&> well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! <&&&> do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? <&&&> I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? <&&&> I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! <&&&> how long do you want to sign a contract for ? <&&&> I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . <&&&> do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? <&&&> Yes , are you ? <&&&> I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . <&&&> You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . <&&&> It wasn't cold out this morning . <&&&> Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! <&&&> Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? <&&&> It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . <&&&> That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . <&&&> Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . <&&&> How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? <&&&> I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . <&&&> Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . Wake up , it's time for school . <&&&> I'm so tired . Let me sleep for five more minutes . <&&&> You have to get up and get ready for school . <&&&> I know , but just five more minutes . <&&&> I can't let you go back to sleep , because you won't wake back up . <&&&> I promise I'll wake up , in five minutes . <&&&> You still need to eat breakfast , take a shower , and get dressed . Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? <&&&> I don ’ t want to . Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset . <&&&> As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . <&&&> Who was chairing the meeting ? <&&&> Bob . <&&&> Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes . <&&&> That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him . <&&&> What was the meeting about ? <&&&> We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . <&&&> It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . <&&&> Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? <&&&> You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . <&&&> Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? Excuse me for being late to work . <&&&> Where have you been ? <&&&> My car broke down . <&&&> That's too bad . Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again . <&&&> Yes , I'll work on it . Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? <&&&> I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . <&&&> I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . <&&&> But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? <&&&> I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? <&&&> But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? <&&&> After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . <&&&> How often do you meet ? <&&&> We plan to get together once a week . <&&&> What days , do you know ? Waiter , please bring me some toast . <&&&> Sure . What kind of toast do you like ? <&&&> Pardon ? <&&&> We have white toast , whole wheat toast and rye toast . We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? Hello , Tom ! <&&&> Hello , Steven ! <&&&> How are you doing ? <&&&> Not bad . What about you ? <&&&> I'm just a little tired . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> I have a lot of work to do in the company recently . Who is the next ? <&&&> I am . Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? <&&&> I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! What do you want to know about me ? <&&&> How about your academic records at college ? <&&&> The average grade of all my courses is above 85 . <&&&> In which subject did you get the highest marks ? <&&&> In mathematics I got a 98 . <&&&> Have you received any scholarships ? Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . <&&&> That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . <&&&> I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? <&&&> I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet . <&&&> OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . <&&&> Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months . <&&&> 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep . <&&&> I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it . <&&&> I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair . <&&&> Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it . Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . <&&&> You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . <&&&> Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? <&&&> The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? I'm really glad that you came to see me . <&&&> I had to . I was missing you a lot . How do you do ? <&&&> How do you do ? <&&&> Do you mind if I introduce myself ? My name is Wang Li . Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ? I need to find a new furniture set for my living room . <&&&> Where are you going to find one ? <&&&> I have no idea . <&&&> Do you want to know where I bought mine ? Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? <&&&> Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . <&&&> What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . <&&&> Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ? <&&&> Is there anything good playing ? <&&&> Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster . <&&&> Really ? I want to go , too . <&&&> OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late . <&&&> No problem . How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . How do you understand the organizational structure of a company ? <&&&> The organizational structure is the company's framework of communication and authority . What is today ? <&&&> Thursday . <&&&> So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! Did you see the fashion awards last night ? <&&&> I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . <&&&> Not interested ? <&&&> Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . <&&&> But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . <&&&> All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . <&&&> Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? <&&&> What , it keeps coming back ? <&&&> Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . <&&&> Flares ? <&&&> They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . Excuse me , how do I get to Wall Street ? <&&&> Take the A train south to the Liberty Ave . stop . You should be able to find it from there . <&&&> I ’ m sorry , but how do I know the subway train is going south ? <&&&> The southbound A trains say Brooklyn . <&&&> O . K . , so it ’ s this one ? <&&&> Yeah . Hey ? What are you doing ? Let the people off the train before you get on . <&&&> Oh , sorry . I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . <&&&> Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? <&&&> Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . Excuse me , sir . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> I heard that we will call at some ports on the way . Is that true ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Where will we call at ? I want to buy some jewellery . <&&&> What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? <&&&> I should like to look at some bracelets . Excuse me , I'm looking for the Alands Morrissette album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie . <&&&> Let's see . If we have it , it should be over there under M .

If you want , we can order it for you . <&&&> That's okay , I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album ? <&&&> Yes , it's right over here . <&&&> Great . One last question , where is your jazz section ? Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? <&&&> Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . <&&&> It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . <&&&> Are you Chinese ? <&&&> Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . <&&&> How do you like it ? <&&&> I like it so far . But my English still needs work . <&&&> I want to study Mandarin and international relations . <&&&> Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? <&&&> They teach regular characters . <&&&> I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . <&&&> You just said your English needs work , yes ? <&&&> Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . <&&&> Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . <&&&> You mean you and I ? <&&&> Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . <&&&> That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? <&&&> Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . <&&&> How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? <&&&> First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . <&&&> Would I help you with writing ? I want to rent a formal suit here.Do you have a purple dress here ? <&&&> Yes . What size are you ? <&&&> I am a size 6 . <&&&> Try this on please . <&&&> This is just my size .

Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ? <&&&> Well , I'd like to buy a watch . <&&&> Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ? <&&&> Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ... <&&&> How about this one ? It's graceful in style . <&&&> Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> How much is it ? <&&&> 500 dollars , Madam . <&&&> I wonder if it keeps good time . <&&&> Surely .

Let me see your passport , please . <&&&> Oh , here you are . <&&&> You come from Germany , don't you ? <&&&> Yes . And come here for tourism . <&&&> How long will you be staying in China ? My mother likes to split hairs . <&&&> What do you mean by that ? <&&&> She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper . You didn't tell me she was married ! <&&&> I tried . You were preoccupied . What is this ? I didn't order that . <&&&> I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . <&&&> I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw . <&&&> I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once . <&&&> Hey !

Hello , Anna speaking ! <&&&> Hey , Anna , this is Jason . <&&&> Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ? <&&&> Yes . How are you , Anna ? <&&&> I am fine . What have you been doing ? <&&&> Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion . <&&&> That's great , congratulations ! <&&&> Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant . I'm sorry , sir . I'm going to have to ask you to leave . <&&&> What ? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here ... <&&&> Well , she apparently doesn't think it's so friendly . Let's go . Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? <&&&> Sure , I have . Will you join ? <&&&> I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . <&&&> You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . <&&&> I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . Hello , Pam . <&&&> I'm glad that you can make it . <&&&> It looks like there are a lot of people inside . <&&&> Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you . <&&&> Should I take my shoes off ? <&&&> We all keep our shoes on indoors . Her dress looks funny . <&&&> I wouldn't say that . It looks fine to me . <&&&> Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year . <&&&> Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . <&&&> Well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is . Have you taken the written test yet ? <&&&> No , I haven't . <&&&> You should study before you take it . <&&&> I have been studying . Ouch ! I'm hurt . <&&&> Are you all right ? We have a variety of trousers . Which one do you like best ? Good morning , Sir . Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ? <&&&> I am indeed . What can you tell me ? <&&&> The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . <&&&> Do I get a card ? <&&&> Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . <&&&> How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . <&&&> The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing . <&&&> That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small . <&&&> I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper . <&&&> A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . <&&&> Here ’ s an interesting ad <&&&> How much is the rent ? <&&&> The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . <&&&> When is the place available ? What is up ? <&&&> Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... <&&&> Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? <&&&> For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . <&&&> I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . <&&&> Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . <&&&> Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . <&&&> Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . <&&&> There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . Is there anything I can do for you ? May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? <&&&> Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . <&&&> Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . <&&&> That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . <&&&> Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? <&&&> Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . <&&&> Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? <&&&> Are you going to make an offer today ? <&&&> Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . Front Desk . What can I do for you ? <&&&> This is Room 320 . Can I have a morning call tomorrow ? <&&&> What time do you want us to wake you up ? We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! <&&&> Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading <&&&> That is preposterous ! <&&&> You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! <&&&> I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! Can you read and write English and French ? <&&&> No , I'm proficient in both written and spoken English , but I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . well , I finished my last final today . <&&&> the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! <&&&> do you want to attend the convocation ? <&&&> certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? <&&&> do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? <&&&> oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . <&&&> no . those you have to provide for yourself . <&&&> what do most of the students do ? <&&&> well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f <&&&> then , I might as well have them made . Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? <&&&> I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . <&&&> Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . <&&&> Have you invested in the stock market before ? <&&&> No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . Mr . Wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ? <&&&> Of course , I ’ Ve enjoyed it very much . I ’ Ve met my old friends and made some new friends . Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? Mary , today a man from an intermediary gave me a call . <&&&> What did he say ? <&&&> He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job . <&&&> What kind of intermediary is it ? <&&&> It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses . Good morning , Madam . Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? <&&&> Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . Good morning , Mr . Green . Please have a seat . I received your resume last Monday and I would like to say I ’ m very impressed . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> May I asked why you are interested in working for us ? <&&&> Your company has an impressive reputation . My uncle worked for your company for many years . <&&&> Oh , did he ? <&&&> Yes , but he retired 5 years ago . <&&&> Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ? <&&&> I ’ m a senior broker in a large company . I deal with clients on a daily basis , handling all aspects of their accounts personally . <&&&> Do you think you are the right candidate for this position ? <&&&> Yes , I do think I am the right candidate for this position . <&&&> Why do you think you ’ re the right candidate for this position ? <&&&> Well , I have a lot of experience in this area . I have all the qualifications you need . I enjoy working with people . In my current job , I ’ m in charge of a team of eight people . <&&&> Well , you might be the person we ’ Ve been looking for . Do you have any questions ? <&&&> Yes , if I were hired , when would you like me to start ? <&&&> At the end of this month . <&&&> And how many accounts would I handle ? <&&&> You ’ ll be supervising six brokers who manage a combined total of 310 accounts . <&&&> What kind of benefit package do you offer ? Where is my back pack ? Where are you from ? <&&&> I'm from Germany . <&&&> So you speak German , don't you ? <&&&> Yeah , but I can speak English , too . <&&&> Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to return these slacks . <&&&> Alright . Do you have your receipt ? <&&&> Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week . <&&&> And why are you returning them ? <&&&> I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match . <&&&> I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . <&&&> Yes , they were thirty percent off . <&&&> I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . <&&&> I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before . <&&&> I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . <&&&> I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here.Can you make an exception this time ? <&&&> Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment.Ma ' am , the manager says I can do it this time . <&&&> Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me . Well , Peter . I'm sorry you're ill . What's the matter with you ? <&&&> I don't know , Doctor . I'm ill . I have a headache and a stomachache . <&&&> Show me your torgue.What did you eat yesterday ? <&&&> Well , Doctor , I . . . <&&&> Did you eat any cake ? <&&&> Yes , I ate some cake . <&&&> Did you eat any ice cream ? Now let's talk about your interests and hobbies . <&&&> Well , I like reading , walking , swimming , hiking and playing basketball <&&&> You have a colorful life . <&&&> Yes . These hobbies have indeed enriched my life <&&&> How do you usually spend your time after work ? Would you like me to type it for you ? <&&&> Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? <&&&> Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . <&&&> Thank you very much . Lisa , can I call Taiwan ? <&&&> Are you homesick ? <&&&> I miss my parents . <&&&> Don't worry about the bill . Just call . <&&&> Can you show me how to make an overseas call ? <&&&> Of course . First dial the code 011 to get an international line . Then you dial Taiwan's country code Herman , why are you so excited ? <&&&> I have met a beautiful girl . <&&&> Have you fallen in love ? Like to come over to our fancy dress party ? <&&&> Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow . If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . <&&&> That's right . Let's go into details of it . <&&&> Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . <&&&> Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? <&&&> No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . <&&&> Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . <&&&> I hope you can try to get them to step up production . <&&&> They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . <&&&> If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . <&&&> I'm sorry . <&&&> What's your last word as to the delivery date then ? <&&&> By the middle of October . This is the best we can do . <&&&> All right . I'll take your words at that . I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! <&&&> Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . <&&&> But it ’ s so old . <&&&> Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? <&&&> No , not at all . <&&&> First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . <&&&> I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? Is there anything I could help you with , sir ? <&&&> Yes , could you show me to your coat section ? <&&&> This way , please . <&&&> Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for . <&&&> These are French coats , sir.They are quite fashionable these days . <&&&> I'd like to try them on for size . <&&&> How does that fit , sir ? <&&&> This seems to be my size . <&&&> It looks good on you . Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine . <&&&> Here . Are you all right ? <&&&> Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache . <&&&> I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor . <&&&> No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining . <&&&> Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . <&&&> I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . May I help you ? <&&&> Give me six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fries , and a large coke . <&&&> You will need to wait a few minutes for fries . They're still in the fryer . Mr . Emory ? I ’ d appreciate it if you would look over these letters before you leave today . <&&&> I ’ d be glad to . Just leave them on my desk . I didn ’ t expect you to finish so soon . <&&&> Thank you , sir . I ’ ll leave them here . If there are no problems , I ’ ll mail them out this afternoon . Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ? <&&&> The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time . <&&&> Which city did you like better ? <&&&> That's hard to say ... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing , too . A lot of museums and galleries . <&&&> And what's Montreal like ? What did you think of it ? hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? <&&&> I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? <&&&> I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? <&&&> I'm in between jobs at the moment . <&&&> what kind of job are you looking for ? <&&&> I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . <&&&> have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . <&&&> What do the Romans do ? <&&&> They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . <&&&> In other words , the Romans do what everyone else does . <&&&> Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> Well , the climate's different for a start . It doesn't rain so much as it does in England . The sun shines more often . <&&&> I envy them the sun . <&&&> I know . You hate the rain , don't you ? <&&&> I certainly do . <&&&> And a Roman really Ioves life . Eye knows how to enjoy himself . <&&&> They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ? So will you come to work with us ? Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ? I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . <&&&> Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? <&&&> Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ? <&&&> Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ? <&&&> My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check . <&&&> Did you work at all during the last pay period ? <&&&> Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money . <&&&> Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? <&&&> Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . <&&&> Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . <&&&> I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . <&&&> Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . <&&&> Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? <&&&> History . <&&&> Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your <&&&> Thirty percent ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? <&&&> Yes . It's an excellent system . <&&&> Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? <&&&> Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . <&&&> I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . <&&&> I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . <&&&> What ? Are you serious ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> But nobody uses Macintosh ! <&&&> That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma How long would you stay , sir ? What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> My stomach hurts , Doctor . Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ? <&&&> umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday . <&&&> Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ? <&&&> No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss . <&&&> Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? <&&&> That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous . <&&&> Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . <&&&> Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? <&&&> We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . <&&&> Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... <&&&> Perhaps you could give her a ring ? Now let's talk about your interests and hobbies . <&&&> Well , I like reading , walking , swimming , hiking and playing basketball <&&&> You have a colorful life . <&&&> Yes . These hobbies have indeed enriched my life <&&&> How do you usually spend your time after work ? <&&&> I prefer to read novels with a cup of tea . <&&&> What kind of books interests you most ? <&&&> Detective books . <&&&> You seem to be a man of imagination and logic . <&&&> To some extent , I regard books as my good companion . <&&&> If so , you can benefit a lot from them . Do you drive a car yourself ? <&&&> Yes , I just bought new car , I drive to work everyday ! <&&&> Great ! When you become new driver , you are better drive as carefully as possible ! <&&&> Sure , I see safety is most important thing ! Accident is awful ! I will take your advice ! <&&&> Besides , traffic signal in downtown area are very annoying , are they ? <&&&> Yes , definitely ! You can't drive freely ! <&&&> Now , we are out of the town , you can drive freely ! <&&&> Compare with speaking , yes ! But things are not good as you expecting ! <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Can you see that road side help ? I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some popcorn and Coke . <&&&> Go ahead . Waste your money . I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> I want to know what's on that channel . <&&&> Oh , good . <&&&> There is a football match . <&&&> I prefer TV play to football . <&&&> OK . Could you turn it down ? <&&&> What are you going to do ? <&&&> I'm going to listen to the radio . Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . <&&&> I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! <&&&> That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . <&&&> It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . <&&&> They see their independence as a kind of character strength . Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? <&&&> No . what's it like ? I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it . <&&&> Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . <&&&> What's the brand ? <&&&> San Yuan . <&&&> Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ? <&&&> I'm not used to other brands . OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . <&&&> Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof . <&&&> Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! <&&&> Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! <&&&> OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . <&&&> The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! <&&&> Thank you , that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . <&&&> Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ” Wild Things ” ? ! Did you see the woman that just left my office ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . <&&&> But it's the style now . That was a really good meal , Gordon . <&&&> It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . <&&&> Well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . <&&&> You're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . <&&&> Let's see how much the bill is . <&&&> Don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . <&&&> What are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . <&&&> No , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . <&&&> No way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . <&&&> Alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . <&&&> That's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . <&&&> Just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? <&&&> You've got a deal . <&&&> Great . Bye . Excuse me , could you please take a picture for us ? <&&&> Sure . Where would you like to stand ? <&&&> Over here with the waterfall in the background , please . Passport , please , madam . <&&&> Just a minute , please.It ' s in my bag.Here it is . <&&&> Thank you.Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form . Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Do you have a reservation ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> May I have your name , please ? <&&&> Yes , it's Mr . Brown . <&&&> Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? <&&&> Oh , this is just fine . <&&&> Please take a seat . <&&&> Thank you . You say he was around average height . <&&&> Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten . <&&&> Weight ? <&&&> I'm not sure . Medium I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . <&&&> Any marks on his face ? <&&&> No , I don't think so . <&&&> Glasses ? I ’ m so excited , mother .

What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? <&&&> I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something .

I think I'm in love ! <&&&> well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? <&&&> oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? <&&&> yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! <&&&> I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . <&&&> I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . <&&&> come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . <&&&> okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . <&&&> all right . But I think you ought to move soon . <&&&> why ? Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do . <&&&> Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ? <&&&> No . It isn't . <&&&> OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment . <&&&> But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ? Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . <&&&> He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . <&&&> Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . <&&&> It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? Can I see your ticket please ? <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> Ok , Mr .

Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . <&&&> My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . <&&&> What are you assigned to do ? <&&&> God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . <&&&> For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . <&&&> You might want to try the mangoes . <&&&> Can you describe a mango to me ? <&&&> It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . <&&&> Do I eat the seed ? <&&&> Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . Are you still busy today ? Ah ! No ! Damn it ! <&&&> It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . <&&&> So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . <&&&> Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? <&&&> No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . <&&&> I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so .

Do you mind , sir ? <&&&> Possibly . What's the actual price ? <&&&> The price will be $ 308 a night . <&&&> $ 308 ! That's not bad . <&&&> Very good . Now , Mr . Sandals , about the room , smoking or nonsmoking ? <&&&> Nonsmoking , definitely ! <&&&> Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking . Now , does a queen sound okay ? <&&&> Yes , that'll be just fine . Where is it ? <&&&> I'm going to the Golden hotel . <&&&> Get in , please . <&&&> Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10 <&&&> Don't worry , you'll be there plenty of time . That is it . 7.15 $ , please . What a surprise meeting you here , Landy . <&&&> I ’ m here as a tourist . Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? <&&&> I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . <&&&> How come ? <&&&> It is a long story .

I have some good news for you . <&&&> What's that ? <&&&> Jenny is getting married . <&&&> Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? <&&&> Tom , that lucky guy . <&&&> The guy always hands the girls in a line .

Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here . <&&&> Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend . <&&&> This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . <&&&> Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one . <&&&> Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su <&&&> That ’ s fine . I would also like a few shirts and a jacket . I don ’ t need them specially made . Those shirts over there look very nice . Are they made of cotton ? <&&&> Yes , they are . How many would you like and of which color ? <&&&> I ’ ll take three light blue ones , please . <&&&> Are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal ? <&&&> Just a casual one - a sport jacket . This one looks nice . I ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . I ’ ll take it . Here ’ s my credit card .

She must be really loaded . <&&&> No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . <&&&> Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . <&&&> I think you've lost it . What's the matter , sir ? You look pale . <&&&> I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . <&&&> Are you often traveling by plane ? <&&&> No , this is the second time . <&&&> That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . <&&&> Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad . <&&&> Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . <&&&> What should I do about it ? May I help you ? <&&&> I would like to check out these books . <&&&> May I see your library card , please ? <&&&> Yes . Here you go . How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? <&&&> Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . <&&&> Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . <&&&> That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . <&&&> You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something . Well , I ’ Ve looked over your resume , Mr . Peepers . <&&&> Please , call me Ted . <&&&> Well , Ted , this is a very impressive resume . However , we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . We ’ ll call you by Friday , if that ’ s all right . <&&&> That ’ s no problem . <&&&> Do you have any other questions ? I went to Super Junior's concert last night .

Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . <&&&> So what are you trying to say to me ? <&&&> It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . Ladies and gentlemen , we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre . Do you know what time it is ? <&&&> Um . Ten ? To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 707 to New York City ? <&&&> Go to Gate 56 , the plane is now boarding , you must hurry . <&&&> Show me the fastest way to get there . <&&&> Instead of walking you can take this shuttle to get you there faster . <&&&> Do you think the plane will leave without me ?

Why don't you try it today ? The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers . <&&&> I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand . <&&&> Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? <&&&> How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . <&&&> Sounds like a good idea . <&&&> We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug . Thank you for seeing me . Did you look over my letter and resume ? <&&&> Yes . Quite good .

He likes children and always wants a child of his own . <&&&> In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . <&&&> Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy .

Here are my blouse , coats and stockings . <&&&> Anything else ? <&&&> Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas . <&&&> Are they to be dry-cleaned ? <&&&> Oh , no . Only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned . I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening . And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched . <&&&> Yes , but not too stiff , right ? <&&&> Exactly . Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned , too ? <&&&> There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days . <&&&> Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening . <&&&> In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then . <&&&> That's a good idea . <&&&> By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday . <&&&> Yes , I noticed it yet . <&&&> The laundry has sewed on a new button for you . <&&&> Oh , thanks a lot . <&&&> I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others . <&&&> Never mind , it doesn't matter .

Damn it ! <&&&> It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . <&&&> So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . <&&&> Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? <&&&> No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . <&&&> I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . <&&&> I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . <&&&> What are we going to do now ? <&&&> I don't know .

Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . <&&&> How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? Well , we've been waiting for our luggage for about one hour . <&&&> What kind of bag is it ? <&&&> It's blue , Samsonite bag . Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . <&&&> Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? <&&&> Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . <&&&> Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . Hello ? <&&&> Hi Tina , It's Joe . <&&&> Hi Joe . <&&&> How's the weather there today ? it's a lovely day , isn't it ? <&&&> yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . <&&&> is she American ? <&&&> yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! <&&&> so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? <&&&> I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . <&&&> What can I do for you ? <&&&> I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? <&&&> Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . Hi Kara , it's Mike here . <&&&> Hi Mike , how are you doing ? <&&&> I'm doing well , and you ? <&&&> Everything is going great . <&&&> Kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday ? Hello ? <&&&> Hi Tina , It's Joe . <&&&> Hi Joe . <&&&> How's the weather there today ? <&&&> It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early . <&&&> What's the temperature ? Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? <&&&> Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . <&&&> That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? So , are we all ready to go ? Come here ! I can see the tall camphor trees from here . <&&&> Yes , we can also see some yew trees . Excuse me , Miss . I feel like vomiting . Can I bother you for some ice water , please ? Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? <&&&> Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . <&&&> Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . <&&&> You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . <&&&> Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ? <&&&> Of course . <&&&> I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ? <&&&> Sure . At present one dollar is equal to 6.4392 yuan . How many dollars would you like to change ? <&&&> 500 dollars , please . <&&&> Please wait for a moment ... Now here is your Chinese currency . See if it's right . It's 3,220 yuan . Please keep this exchange memo . You may need it for converting when you leave China . Hello . In order to kill your time you can experience our facial massage for free . Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . <&&&> Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . <&&&> Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . <&&&> I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . <&&&> I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . <&&&> You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore <&&&> Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . <&&&> Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . Can I help you ? <&&&> Thank you , but I'm just looking around . How much does this skirt cost ? <&&&> This is the new style.Two hundred and twenty-eight . <&&&> May I try it on ? <&&&> Of course , please . Excuse me . Is there any body here ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . <&&&> Sure , come on in . <&&&> Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? <&&&> My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? <&&&> I'm a back-packer from America . <&&&> What is a back-packer ? <&&&> It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . <&&&> Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . <&&&> Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . Come on in . Let me show you around . Here ’ s the living room . <&&&> Great . The view from this window is wonderful . <&&&> This is the kitchen . <&&&> It looks new . <&&&> Yes . We just renovated a few month ago . <&&&> I like it . <&&&> Here ’ s the master bedroom . <&&&> Wow , it ’ s nice . What did you say about the rent ? <&&&> $ 900 a month . <&&&> Does that include utilities ? You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . I hear many people here speak French . <&&&> It is because Montreal is a bilingual city . I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away . <&&&> I knew this would happen some day . <&&&> Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? <&&&> Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . <&&&> I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? <&&&> Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . <&&&> No problem . What should I bring ? It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . <&&&> We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . What is your salary now ? <&&&> My present pay is RIB 3 , 000 yuan each month . <&&&> What's your expected salary ? Hi , Natasha , how's life ? <&&&> Great . My family came to visit me . <&&&> Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? <&&&> My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . <&&&> Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ? <&&&> The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products . <&&&> I see . Is there a problem , officer ? <&&&> Did you notice that stop sign you ran through ? <&&&> I'm sorry , I didn't even notice it . <&&&> You didn't see it ? <&&&> I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it . <&&&> That's true . Those bushes are a problem . <&&&> I swear that I didn't mean to run it . <&&&> I can understand why you didn't stop for it . <&&&> Are you going to give me a ticket today , sir ? We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? <&&&> I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . What's your favorite TV Program ? <&&&> I like variety shows . <&&&> I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . <&&&> Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . <&&&> I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . <&&&> Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . <&&&> Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? <&&&> History . <&&&> Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? <&&&> What do you mean ? What kinds of things do you like to do ? <&&&> I've always liked to draw and paint . May , is the university a terrible place ? <&&&> Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? <&&&> Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . <&&&> Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . <&&&> How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . <&&&> Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . <&&&> Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? <&&&> Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . <&&&> What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? <&&&> This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? You look a bit dull today . What's up ? <&&&> Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . <&&&> I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . <&&&> The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . <&&&> Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ? <&&&> Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ? <&&&> That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them . <&&&> Matinee or evening ? <&&&> Evening . <&&&> Circle or stalls ? Does your country export a lot of natural resources ? <&&&> We export some coal to European countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to Europe , north America , and China . <&&&> Which resources do you have to import ? <&&&> We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . Look ! There are playing The Matrix today . <&&&> You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement . <&&&> How nice ! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars ? <&&&> Yes . But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks . So it will be safer . I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? <&&&> Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ? <&&&> I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ? <&&&> I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . <&&&> Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists . <&&&> Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . <&&&> Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . <&&&> Seriously ? <&&&> Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . <&&&> Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . <&&&> Absolutely . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine . Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? <&&&> We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? Could you help me to register for a class ? Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ? Hello , Jim . Where are you going ? <&&&> To the cinema . What about coming with me ? <&&&> No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me . <&&&> What a pity . I believe it's a very good film . <&&&> Do you go to the cinema a lot ? <&&&> Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly <&&&> Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? <&&&> No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . <&&&> Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? <&&&> I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . <&&&> Oh , does she ? That's convenient . <&&&> Yes , but I want to go to the country . <&&&> Don't you like the sea ? <&&&> Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ? <&&&> I'm going to stay at home . <&&&> Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ?

Could you tell me how much a return flight costs ?

Do you have alcohol ? <&&&> Yes , I have got some special local product , I want to take them for my friends . <&&&> How many bottles have you got with you ? <&&&> Four bottles . <&&&> I'm sorry .

Hello ? <&&&> Hi , is Heather there please ? <&&&> Sorry , I think you have the wrong number . <&&&> Is this 617-228-2289 ? <&&&> Yes . Who are you looking for again ? <&&&> Heather Johnson . <&&&> Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now . <&&&> Do you know where she went ? <&&&> She went to the store to buy some groceries .

Have you come to a decision ? <&&&> I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? <&&&> Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . <&&&> Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? <&&&> Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution .

I already got my invitation from her earlier . <&&&> I believe that she will give me the invitation today . <&&&> Are you even going to go ? <&&&> Yeah , it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year . <&&&> Exactly , it seems like it's going to be loads of fun . <&&&> When exactly does the party start ? <&&&> The invitation says it starts at 8 Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . <&&&> Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? Do you have girlfriend ? <&&&> Yes , why ? <&&&> Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . <&&&> So ? <&&&> So I think I may fall in love with her . <&&&> That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? <&&&> Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? <&&&> That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . <&&&> That's what I do . <&&&> And you think about her all the time ? <&&&> Yes . Did you vote ? <&&&> Of course ! Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . <&&&> Why do you say that ? <&&&> The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . I don't know whether or not to believe him . <&&&> You can trust him . He always tells the truth . <&&&> But it's really too important to me . Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ? <&&&> I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry . <&&&> I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? <&&&> I ’ m afraid not , George . You gotta know something , I ’ m not available any more . but I know Becky has a crush on ya . Do you know which stop we get off at ? <&&&> We still have more to go , I think . <&&&> We've been on this bus for a while now . <&&&> You're right . <&&&> Should we have gotten off the bus already ? <&&&> I don't think so . Good morning , Madam . Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? <&&&> Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . <&&&> Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for . <&&&> Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? <&&&> Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . <&&&> Then it'll give me my money ? <&&&> Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service . <&&&> Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? <&&&> Yes , then enter the amount you want . Hey , what's the matter ? <&&&> It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . How was your shopping trip Martin ? <&&&> Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ? <&&&> Sure , we have several different styles you may choose . How high of a heel do you want ? <&&&> Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best . Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? <&&&> I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . <&&&> why ? <&&&> many say more development opportunities can be found there . <&&&> that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . <&&&> and there're higher salaries there . <&&&> well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . <&&&> I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . <&&&> one person ? How about your girlfriend ? <&&&> oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . <&&&> sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ? <&&&> I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? <&&&> I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . <&&&> new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . <&&&> do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? <&&&> that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ? <&&&> yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . <&&&> I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be Excuse me , can I have your passport , your immigration form and your Customs Declaration Form , please ? <&&&> OK . Here you are . <&&&> How long will you be staying at Hotel in China ? <&&&> About three weeks . <&&&> And what's the purpose of your visit ? <&&&> Sightseeing . <&&&> And where will you be staying ? <&&&> At the Friendship Hotel in Beijing . <&&&> OK . Could you put your hand baggage on the counter , please ? Do you have any gifts , or food in here ? <&&&> Yes , I have some fresh apples in my suitcase . <&&&> I'm sorry , sir , you can't bring fresh fruit into China . I'm going to have to confiscate these . May I order some cable from you today ? <&&&> Okay , what package would you like to order ? <&&&> I'm not sure of what packages you offer . <&&&> We offer packages with all the movie channels . <&&&> Are there any other packages ? <&&&> We also have packages with all the sports channels . <&&&> I want a package that has the basic and movie channels . <&&&> We have that available . <&&&> I would like to get that . <&&&> Would you like anything else with your package ? <&&&> That's it , but will I be able to add more channels at another time ? The weekend's finally here ! <&&&> And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that . <&&&> Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow . are you looking for a course ? May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I ’ m here for an interview as requested . <&&&> You are Miss Liu ? <&&&> That ’ s right . <&&&> Please take a seat . <&&&> Thank you , madam . <&&&> We have received your letter and resume , and we thought we would like to ask you to come here for an interview . <&&&> It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview . <&&&> Have you brought your credentials ? Um , which of them is the better typist ? Steven , what's your idea of price ? <&&&> The best we can do is $ 120 per case . <&&&> I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? <&&&> Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? <&&&> Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? <&&&> Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . <&&&> Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six . Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ? <&&&> Good idea . Is there a good movie on ? <&&&> What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time . <&&&> All right . But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose . <&&&> My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening . <&&&> What time does it begin ? <&&&> At eight thirty . What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress ! <&&&> Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . <&&&> It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . <&&&> Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so . <&&&> Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste . Where shall we go on vacation this summer ? <&&&> Well , that depends . Tell me where you want to go ? <&&&> Venice . I have great interests in the boats . <&&&> That's interesting to travel by boat to see the whole city that is between the sea and sky . But personally I like Greek better . I'd like to have these shirts washed and ironed . <&&&> Ok , do you want us to use starch ? <&&&> Yes , heavy starch in the collar , please . <&&&> Yes , sir . Your shirts will be ready by Thursday morning . Anything else ? <&&&> I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent . <&&&> No problem , sir . <&&&> Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ? <&&&> We remain open from 9am till 8p m . <&&&> I see . <&&&> Here is your laundry ticket , sir . <&&&> Thank you . I'd like to get my laundry . Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? This'd better be good . I'm about to fire you all and find another company . <&&&> We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans !

It ’ s not difficult to get there . <&&&> I think I ’ m going in the wrong direction , aren ’ t ? <&&&> Yes . First , you need to turn around . Do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ? <&&&> Yes , I do . They are about two miles away , right ? <&&&> That ’ s right . Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . Follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . It ’ s a really big hotel . You can ’ t miss it . Turn left at the hotel . <&&&> So , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . Got it . <&&&> Then you just go straight on until you see the station ahead of you . <&&&> Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help . Joseph , who is that woman ? <&&&> That's Susan . <&&&> What does she do for work ? <&&&> She's a lawyer . <&&&> Is she American ? <&&&> No , but she speaks English fluently . <&&&> She's really tall . Do you know her ? <&&&> Yes , I know her . We're friends . <&&&> Who's that man standing next to her ? <&&&> Which man ? <&&&> That short guy on her right . What's his name ? <&&&> Oh , that's Matt . <&&&> He's really good looking . <&&&> Yeah . <&&&> Do you know him ? <&&&> I don't know him , but I think my sister does . <&&&> Is he married ? <&&&> Yes , he's married . Do you take reservations ? <&&&> Of course . Reservations aren't necessary , but we recommend them as our restaurant can get quite busy . <&&&> I need a table for two for tonight . <&&&> What time ? <&&&> We'd like to be seated at 8p m . <&&&> Smoking or non ? <&&&> Non-smoking . <&&&> What name is the reservation under ?

Thanks for coming to see me today . <&&&> It's no problem . I was really missing you anyway . <&&&> I missed you too . <&&&> Why haven't you tried to come see me then ? <&&&> I've been really busy . <&&&> Doing what ? That's great ! We made 20 minutes earlier . <&&&> Good thing , we took a taxi . How time flies ! <&&&> May and Danny have already grown up . <&&&> I can still remember our first date . <&&&> Look at that big tree over there . <&&&> Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there . I ’ Ve got a new boss . <&&&> Oh , what ’ s he like ? <&&&> Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . <&&&> Yes . I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? <&&&> No , I haven ’ t . The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . <&&&> Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? What are you doing tomorrow ? <&&&> Nothing really . <&&&> Let's watch a movie or something . <&&&> What's on these days ? <&&&> I think they're playing Lord of the Rings I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? <&&&> I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . <&&&> We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . <&&&> I propose we accept the minutes . <&&&> Good . Do I have a second ? <&&&> I second . <&&&> motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? It is really exciting news . <&&&> What news ? <&&&> You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . <&&&> You know what we will get ? <&&&> We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . <&&&> What docking station ? Is there a daily passenger ship to Dalian ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> How many days does it take to Dalian ? <&&&> About one day . It arrives in Dalian at 10:00 a . m . tomorrow . <&&&> How many ports do we call at on our passage to Qingdao ? <&&&> Four ports . Is it possible that I have a business trip abroad and work in American once in a while ? <&&&> Yes . We are a foreign-invested company and there are many chances to go abroad . <&&&> Is there any training program for the employees to make a further study ? Peter , which club do you want to join ? <&&&> I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? Would you like to come to our factory for a visit ? <&&&> Oh , yes.Thank you . I'd be glad to . <&&&> You can look around our new workshops and the automatic machines . You look like a basket case . <&&&> I'm not surprised . <&&&> What's the problem ? What upsets you ? <&&&> My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . <&&&> It is not your mother finding one for you ? <&&&> I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . <&&&> Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . <&&&> You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . <&&&> No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . <&&&> I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . <&&&> Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . <&&&> That must be very beautiful . So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? <&&&> Nine total . Seven children and my parents . Do you want some dessert ? <&&&> No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? <&&&> Where is our waitress anyway ? <&&&> Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ?

It's nice to meet you . <&&&> Carson . It's nice to mee you , too . <&&&> the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ? OK , sir . Your suit will be available in five days . <&&&> Thank you . Do I have to pay in advance ? <&&&> Yes , you should pay half of the cost in advance . Are you ready ? <&&&> Ready for what ? <&&&> Ready for the big switch . <&&&> What are you talking about ? <&&&> The nation is switching to digital TV . <&&&> Oh . Of course I'm ready . <&&&> Did you buy the converter ? Hello , do you know anywhere that sells cheap cashmere sweaters ? Hey , Mary , what's up ? <&&&> Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . <&&&> Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? <&&&> Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . <&&&> It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? <&&&> There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . <&&&> Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . <&&&> I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ? <&&&> Sure . It's down this street on the left . <&&&> Is it far from here ? <&&&> No , it's not far . <&&&> How far is it ? <&&&> About a mile and a half . <&&&> How long does it take to get there ? Gordon , you're ever so late . <&&&> Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . <&&&> But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . <&&&> Well , I missed several buses . <&&&> How on earth can you miss several buses ? <&&&> I , ah ... , I got have late . Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick . <&&&> Wow , what a great burd ! <&&&> She sure knows how to strut her stuff . <&&&> She's a real turn-on , alright ? <&&&> And look out she's dressed . <&&&> Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . <&&&> No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . <&&&> Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . <&&&> I think you've lost it . <&&&> Well , that's my opinion . <&&&> I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . <&&&> Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . Let's see if we forget anything . <&&&> Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . <&&&> Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . What's the date today Mr.Brown . I don't have a calendar . <&&&> Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 . <&&&> 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . <&&&> What time is your appointment ? <&&&> It is at 8 o'clock . <&&&> What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? <&&&> I don't know what time it is.It must be about 6 o'clock . I have to go now . I don't want to be late . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I am returning these books . <&&&> What did you do to this book ? <&&&> I accidentally ripped the cover . <&&&> You will need to pay for the damage . <&&&> How much do I need to pay ? How do we do timesheets here ? <&&&> They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? <&&&> Yes , I already have one . <&&&> OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? <&&&> I am kind of confused . <&&&> Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? <&&&> I'm not quite sure . <&&&> Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? <&&&> No , I have no idea what you are talking about . May I help you ? How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? <&&&> I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . <&&&> Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? <&&&> I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? <&&&> I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! <&&&> I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . <&&&> I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . <&&&> Do you have a brand preference for anything ? <&&&> I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . Do you mind if we call on you this evening ? Are you free this afternoon ? <&&&> I'm afraid I'm going to the gym for a workout . <&&&> How long have you been there ? <&&&> I began to went there last month . <&&&> Is there any change ? <&&&> Well , I think I'm in better condition now . <&&&> Really ? Is it tiring ? May I help you ? <&&&> What time will the library be closing ? I would like to get my driver's license today . <&&&> You will have to take your driving test . Have you taken it yet ? <&&&> I haven't taken it yet . <&&&> Could you fill these papers out , please ? <&&&> Can I take my test right now ? I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? <&&&> Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . <&&&> I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . <&&&> I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? <&&&> Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . <&&&> So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? <&&&> No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . Can you lend me fifty bucks ? <&&&> What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? <&&&> I guess I don't earn enough . <&&&> No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . How was the movie last night ? <&&&> I didn't really like it . <&&&> Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . Bill , where are we going to stay tonight ? What's the weather like ? <&&&> I don't know . I just woke up . <&&&> Why don't you look outside ? <&&&> Okay . It looks like rain . <&&&> Why do you say that ? <&&&> The sky is gray . <&&&> Is it raining right now ? <&&&> No . I would like to buy one round trip plane ticket to Hong Kong , please . <&&&> For what days , madam ? <&&&> Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th . <&&&> Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat ? <&&&> I prefer to sit next to a window . <&&&> How would like to pay ? <&&&> I have a Master Card . Good afternoon , sir . Please sit here . <&&&> A haircut and a shave , please . <&&&> How would you like your hair cut , sir ? <&&&> Short on both sides . Not so much off at the back . <&&&> Very well , sir . Do you want me to trim your beard ? <&&&> Yes , please . <&&&> Now have a look , please . Is it all right ? Hello ! <&&&> Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . <&&&> Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ? <&&&> It's pretty nice , but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon . Hotel living is not for me . <&&&> I know what you mean . Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . <&&&> Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . <&&&> You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? Do you need any help ? <&&&> I need some help catching up . Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox ? <&&&> I like xeroxing . <&&&> Thank you ! There are papers on the table to start with . <&&&> OK , I will get right to that . <&&&> I really appreciate the help . How many years have you been with the company ? I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . <&&&> Well , we just got in some mangoes . <&&&> Mangoes . What are they ? <&&&> Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . <&&&> Can you eat the nut ? <&&&> No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . <&&&> How much are they ? <&&&> Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . <&&&> What does a mango taste like ? <&&&> They're like a citrus fruit . <&&&> How do I know if it's ripe ? <&&&> You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ? <&&&> There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ? Good morning , Mr . Smith . <&&&> Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ? <&&&> It is 9 o'clock now . <&&&> I see . What is today's schedule ? <&&&> You have two meetings today . One is at 10 am , and the other is at 2 pm . After the meeting , you will have dinner with Mr . Brown at the Chinese restaurant in Sister Hotel . <&&&> OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts . Hi , Walter ! <&&&> Hi , Sterling ! Happy Birthday , Mary ! <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . <&&&> What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? <&&&> I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . <&&&> Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . <&&&> Really ? It looks so nice . <&&&> Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . <&&&> All right . <&&&> How about some fish ? <&&&> No , thanks . I've had enough .

Do you like the apartment so far ? <&&&> I see a problem . <&&&> What ’ s the problem ? <&&&> I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking . <&&&> That ’ s no big deal . <&&&> It ’ s going to be a problem when my water bill comes . <&&&> What do you want me to do about it ? <&&&> I would like you to fix the problem . <&&&> I won ’ t be able to do that right now . <&&&> Well , I won ’ t be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed . Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? <&&&> haven't been sleeping well recently . <&&&> what's the problem ? <&&&> every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . Hi Mike . What have you been up to ? <&&&> Not much . I started exercising . <&&&> Trying to get in shape ? <&&&> Yeah , and I need to start improving my health . <&&&> Me too . What are you doing besides exercising ? <&&&> That's about all . <&&&> I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously . <&&&> Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems . I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! <&&&> Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ?

It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . <&&&> Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel .

It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . <&&&> Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . <&&&> When will we get one of those ? The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? Is your city a historical place ? <&&&> Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . <&&&> How did it grow into such a large place ? <&&&> Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here .

The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . Good evening . <&&&> Good evening .

What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? <&&&> Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . Is this the foreign exchange department ? <&&&> Yes , can I help you ? <&&&> I need some US Dollars . <&&&> What kind of currency have you got ? <&&&> RIB . By the way , what is the exchange rate today ? <&&&> One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan . What kind of car is best for me ? <&&&> For you , I would recommend this one here . <&&&> The compact ?

What kind of safety features are we talking about ? <&&&> This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . <&&&> You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? Hello , Mr Brown .

You ’ re ready , right ? <&&&> Ready for what ? <&&&> Are you ready to transfer tomorrow ? <&&&> Yes . I am ready . <&&&> You ’ re not nervous ? <&&&> Of course I ’ m nervous . <&&&> What are you most nervous about ? <&&&> I won ’ t know anybody at that school . <&&&> You shouldn ’ t be nervous about that . <&&&> Why not ? The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! <&&&> Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . <&&&> Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . <&&&> What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ? <&&&> Autumn is also very nice in Washington . <&&&> Is it very cold in winter there ? <&&&> No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . <&&&> Does it rain a lot in summer there ? <&&&> Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? I see by your resume that you have been working ? <&&&> Yes , I have worked for four years with a Canadian Company . I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! Are you feeling better today , Bill ? <&&&> Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . <&&&> You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . <&&&> You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . <&&&> But you should make up your mind first . Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? <&&&> Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . <&&&> Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . May I speak to Marry ? you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? <&&&> no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . <&&&> but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . <&&&> we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . <&&&> can't you hang out with them , too ? <&&&> I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . <&&&> maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . <&&&> I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . <&&&> it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . <&&&> you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . <&&&> she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . Hello . I need to disconnect my phone , please . <&&&> All right .

Maybe going around for a while . <&&&> Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? <&&&> Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . <&&&> Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . <&&&> You hit the nail right on the head . <&&&> Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . <&&&> Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? <&&&> How about this sunday ? <&&&> Ok , cool . excuse me ; is this seat taken ? <&&&> no . It's all yours . <&&&> thank you very much .

Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ? <&&&> Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class . <&&&> You sound exhausted .

You know we will only be in America for about a year . <&&&> Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart . <&&&> What are those stores ? I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . <&&&> I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . <&&&> I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . <&&&> Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? <&&&> I smoke around 30 each day . <&&&> Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far . <&&&> If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . Reservation Center , Air China . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes .

What are you looking for ? <&&&> My laptop , do you see it ? <&&&> Yes , your laptop is on the chair . Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . <&&&> Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . <&&&> Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? I know that you are interested in our washers . <&&&> Yes , we are thinking of placing an order . However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery . <&&&> We supply washers of all types and sizes .

Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? <&&&> Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? <&&&> What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! <&&&> Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . What's wrong with you ? <&&&> My head hurts badly . That was heaven ! We're now staying at the Holiday Inn . How do we get to the airport ? <&&&> We have shuttle buses leaving for the airport from downtown every 20 minutes The bus stops at Holiday Inn as well . Be sure to get on the bus before 30 . so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? <&&&> well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? <&&&> I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . <&&&> do you know anyone in the play ? <&&&> actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . <&&&> really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? <&&&> that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . <&&&> so you've seen other plays that he's directed ? <&&&> quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? Yes , I think there is something wrong with my car . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is . <&&&> Let me see . <&&&> Is it serious ? <&&&> No , the damage is minor . I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . <&&&> Have you tried university part-time jobs ? <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . <&&&> Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? <&&&> Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . <&&&> I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . <&&&> Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . <&&&> But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . <&&&> I have an idea . <&&&> What ? what are you doing ? <&&&> I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . <&&&> you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? <&&&> I guess you could say that .

Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . <&&&> Did you play a lot of games when you were little ? <&&&> My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . <&&&> Do you still like playing those games ? <&&&> Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? <&&&> Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . <&&&> Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? <&&&> No , I prefer to play with people I know . <&&&> How about mah-jong ? <&&&> It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . <&&&> I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ? <&&&> I'm sorry . He's not in right now . Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? <&&&> Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . What do you need ? <&&&> I need to use the Internet . <&&&> You have your library card , right ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> There is a wait right now to use the computers .

What do you think of when you're praying ? <&&&> I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind . You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? <&&&> I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . <&&&> I believe industry is making us wealthier . <&&&> I don ’ t believe that . <&&&> And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . Excuse me . Wedding rings ! Hello sir , how can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need this prescription please . <&&&> Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ? <&&&> Capsules are fine . <&&&> Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day.Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol ! <&&&> Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose ! <&&&> Okay , anything else I can get you ? <&&&> Oh , yes , I almost forgot !

I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . <&&&> You have it right .

Will you introduce me to the new colleague ? <&&&> Haven't you met yet ? There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . <&&&> What is a tornado warning ? <&&&> It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . <&&&> Really ? In New Berlin ? <&&&> No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . <&&&> I understand . They think a tornado might come . <&&&> Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . <&&&> And the second stage is called a tornado warning . <&&&> Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . <&&&> It's scary . <&&&> Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . <&&&> What do you mean a loud train ? <&&&> That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . <&&&> But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? <&&&> Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . <&&&> Have you seen a lot of them ? <&&&> I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . <&&&> Did it hit their house ? <&&&> No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . <&&&> What were they doing when you called ? Did everyone fill out their entry permits ? <&&&> Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants . <&&&> Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ... <&&&> It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne ! <&&&> That's because it's time . <&&&> Time for what ? <&&&> It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... <&&&> You mean get married now ? On the plane ? <&&&> Why not ? I've got the rings ready . Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy . <&&&> Nice to meet you , I'am Simon .

Can I help you ? <&&&> Well , I am looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee . <&&&> Oh , it's the high time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a preseason sale on all our winter apparel . <&&&> Really ? What's that ? <&&&> Every thing for winter is 20 % off . <&&&> I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater ? Operator . <&&&> Hello . I'd like to make a call to Australia . <&&&> You can call direct if you like . <&&&> Oh , can I ? <&&&> Yes , please . <&&&> Could you please tell me the international prefix and the country code for Australia ? <&&&> Yes , the code for Australia is 61 and then dial the city code and the number . Start with the international code which is 00 . <&&&> What time do the special rates apply ? <&&&> Between six in the evening and eight in the morning , sir . <&&&> I wonder if I can charge this call to my hotel room . <&&&> Certainly . Tell me the room number and your name , please ? <&&&> This is Mr . Ma in room 215 . <&&&> OK , Mr . Ma . I'll tell the front desk clerk the charge afterwards . <&&&> Thanks very much for your help . Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? <&&&> Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? <&&&> Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping . <&&&> Do you know how to get the bank account ? Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . <&&&> I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . You're late . <&&&> I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . <&&&> My phone ? <&&&> Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . <&&&> Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . <&&&> So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . Could you tell me where the cereal is ? <&&&> If you go to the breakfast aisle , you'll find the cereal there . <&&&> What aisle is that ? <&&&> You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars . <&&&> I know where that is at . <&&&> Is there anything else you need help finding ? <&&&> Could you point me toward the dishwashing detergent ? <&&&> That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper . <&&&> I didn't even think about that . <&&&> That's where it is . Honey , could you help me operate the VD player ? It can't play . <&&&> Oh , are the connections correct ? <&&&> I think so . <&&&> Let me see . Look ! You confused the video frequency with the audio frequency . <&&&> I'm too careless . <&&&> Can it work now ? <&&&> No . What's today's date ? And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof . <&&&> That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ? <&&&> See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . <&&&> You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing . <&&&> Nothing ? <&&&> Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . <&&&> You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me . <&&&> Engaged ? <&&&> Come on . Excuse me , can I deposit valuables here ? <&&&> Surely of course . <&&&> Here is the bag . Is that free ? I'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ? <&&&> But of course ! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner ? <&&&> She deserves nothing but the best , of course . <&&&> In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding . <&&&> I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant . Do you have another one in mind ? Could I have a word with you , Madam ? <&&&> Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . <&&&> I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow . <&&&> So sorry to hear that . What's wrong with you ? <&&&> I feel sick and coughed a lot at night . <&&&> Is that serious ? You ought to see a doctor . I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . <&&&> Don't you know they've already broken up ? <&&&> I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? <&&&> Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? <&&&> Is today OK ? <&&&> Sorry , I can't go today . You're being childish . Your nose will heal . And so will your pride , if you let it . <&&&> I'll have us ready for Stars.com by the end of next week . After that , I don't know . <&&&> Don't know what ? <&&&> Let's just say there could be some big changes around here . <&&&> Is that right ? Like what kind of changes ? My eyes water continuously . Why ? <&&&> Perhaps because of the dirty air . <&&&> What is there in the air ? Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? <&&&> Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! <&&&> Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . <&&&> Fine ! What do you need ? <&&&> OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives . <&&&> Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost ! <&&&> Never mind that . Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki . If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles . <&&&> Is that all , your majesty ? Hi , Sue . What's up ? <&&&> Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? <&&&> Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . <&&&> Really ? What's he been doing ? <&&&> You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . <&&&> Are you ? What are you busy with ? I have to miss school next week . <&&&> Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here ? Are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? <&&&> I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? <&&&> If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ? Carrie , I want to buy a pair of leather shoes to wear for the interview tomorrow . Can you tell me a little about Paris ? <&&&> Sure . What do you expect to know ? <&&&> I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ... So , are we all ready to go ? <&&&> Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed.we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . <&&&> Did you get the camera ? <&&&> Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ? <&&&> Yup , it ’ s all set . <&&&> You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ? <&&&> I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered . <&&&> Well.let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ? <&&&> I think I ’ ll stay in on Saturday and rest . I would like to order cable . <&&&> Sure , what package do you want ? <&&&> What kinds of packages do you offer ? <&&&> We have all kinds of movie channel packages . we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? <&&&> I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? <&&&> oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . <&&&> Jack ? <&&&> yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? <&&&> I will never go out with him anymore . <&&&> why did you say so ? <&&&> last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! <&&&> oh , really ? <&&&> he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . <&&&> are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ? <&&&> it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . <&&&> what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ? I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed . <&&&> Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? <&&&> I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! <&&&> Whatever am i going to tell me parents . what a nice uniform ! <&&&> thanks ; do you like it ? <&&&> not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ? <&&&> Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ? <&&&> My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check . <&&&> Did you work at all during the last pay period ? <&&&> Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money . <&&&> Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? <&&&> Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form . <&&&> Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . <&&&> Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . Now , Mr.William , a little personal information first , are you married ? <&&&> Yes . I am . Actually my wife is a teacher . <&&&> What's your major ? <&&&> German . <&&&> How long have you been study in German ? <&&&> Since I first met my wife , about three years . oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? <&&&> it's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . <&&&> Cindy , you're so cute . <&&&> she is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? <&&&> I have a little white cat . What can I do for you , sir ? It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . <&&&> You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . <&&&> I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . <&&&> What kind of errands do we need to run ? <&&&> Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . <&&&> I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . <&&&> Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? <&&&> Don't brother me ! <&&&> Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help . <&&&> Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . <&&&> So , what's the problem ? <&&&> I drew a blank on the algebra test . <&&&> No kidding !

Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday ? <&&&> I've heard about it , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . <&&&> Really ? I got mine from her this morning . <&&&> I'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow . <&&&> You're probably right , do you intend on going to the party ? <&&&> I want to . I heard it's going to be really fun . <&&&> I know , it does sound pretty awesome . <&&&> Well , when does the party start ? <&&&> It's supposed to start at about eight . <&&&> How many invitations has she given out ? There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! <&&&> Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? <&&&> I love fruit flavored ices the best . <&&&> I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . <&&&> What is your least favorite ice cream ? <&&&> I don't like peppermint ice cream .

We used to work at Lemans together . <&&&> Oh , sure . How are you ? Long time no see . How are things at Lemans ? <&&&> It's about the same . I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? Can I get you something to drink ? <&&&> Sure , but I don't drink much .

I'm sorry to interrupt you . Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you . <&&&> These red ones ? I'm not sure . <&&&> No , the yellow ones . <&&&> Oh , these ? Hmm ... Yellow isn't a good color for me . Excuse me , do you speak English ? Can you effect shipment during September ? <&&&> I don't think we can make it . <&&&> Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? <&&&> By the middle of October . <&&&> It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season . <&&&> Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery . <&&&> Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? <&&&> Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do . Hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ? <&&&> Sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . Your teacher has left you not very much homework this weekend . Are you going out again ? Hello . This is Hamilton ’ s Heating and cooling service . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . My home freezer is not working properly . <&&&> What ’ s the problem ? <&&&> It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted . <&&&> Maybe the compressor is going bad . <&&&> Can you send the technician to check it out ? <&&&> Sure . But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit . If your freezer needs parts , there will be an additional charge . Have you seen that house ? <&&&> Yes , it looks interesting . <&&&> You're right . I love it very much . <&&&> It must be old . <&&&> At least more than 100 years old . <&&&> Let's enter it ! <&&&> I can't open the door .

Could I speak to Mr . Wu , please ? <&&&> Who ’ s calling , please ? Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? <&&&> Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? <&&&> Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . <&&&> That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . <&&&> Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? <&&&> When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ? <&&&> just after 2 am . I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up . Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day . <&&&> I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? <&&&> Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop . <&&&> Right ! <&&&> I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . <&&&> Ok . <&&&> Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . <&&&> Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . <&&&> You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . Come to think of it , there is one rule in this house , Mary . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> When you go out with friends , I don't want you to stay out too late . <&&&> Okay . <&&&> We maintain a curfew for Cindy because she's just 16 . <&&&> How late can we stay out ? <&&&> You can stay out till 10 p . m . <&&&> But if we're going to be late ? Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . <&&&> There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . <&&&> I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . <&&&> Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . <&&&> When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? <&&&> Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . <&&&> When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things . <&&&> That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . Ten dollars ? Maybe there are a lot of them ... <&&&> Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating . <&&&> Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ? <&&&> I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad . I'm sorry , I've lost my tags and receipt . What can I do about it ? <&&&> I see . What is your baggage ? And do you remember the tag's number or color ? <&&&> It's a suitcase . Its colour is blue . <&&&> Could you give me a description of your case ? <&&&> It's like this , it's square with a leather cover . <&&&> I'll check it for you . I've found it . Is this yours ? <&&&> Yes , it is the right one <&&&> Will you show me your key card , please ? Jane , the meeting is scheduled from 1:00 this afternoon . Have you made the necessary arrangements ? <&&&> Yes , Mr . Miller . We'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting . <&&&> That's right . The meeting is very important . Where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins ? <&&&> In the dining room . It's spacious there . <&&&> We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting . <&&&> I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English . Hello , I would like to buy some business cards . <&&&> Excellent . How many would you like ? <&&&> Two thousand would be fine . <&&&> You need to fill out this form , please . <&&&> All I want is the same thing on this card . <&&&> That will be no problem , sir . <&&&> OK , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card . <&&&> Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . <&&&> Do you think you could finish it in three days ? Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! <&&&> Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . <&&&> Who taught you to put on make-up ? <&&&> It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . <&&&> Can you teach me how to do make-up ? <&&&> Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . Hi , how are you ? <&&&> I'm fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It's hard to keep track of everything around here . <&&&> That's for sure . You're new , too , huh ? I ’ m moving out . Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! <&&&> What is it ? What happened ? <&&&> I think someone is stalking me . <&&&> No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? <&&&> I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . <&&&> Did he leave when you left ? <&&&> Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> He followed me all the way home ! <&&&> That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . <&&&> Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? <&&&> Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . <&&&> Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! Could you give us a detailed description of the properties of your product ? <&&&> OK . The X2500 has the unique feature of providing better data flow with less input time . It will reduce your work load at the office . <&&&> Could you tell me more about it ? <&&&> Of course . One of the real pluses of this product is that it is of very high quality , and of compact size . No one can match us so far as quality is concerned . <&&&> Can you introduce its price level to me ? I think Andy's party will be fun . <&&&> Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . <&&&> What's that ? <&&&> Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? I need to talk to you about something . <&&&> What did you need to talk about ? Can I see the doctor ? <&&&> Yes , do you have an appointment ? <&&&> No , I don't . <&&&> Well . The doctor doesn't see nobody without an appointment . <&&&> Well , I am spending my vacation here and I have a stomachache and ... <&&&> Oh , I see . Maybe we can fit you in at 3 . <&&&> I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ... <&&&> Oh , why didn't you say it's an emergency ? Here , fill out this form and take a seat . I'll send you in next.You don't have insurance ? <&&&> No , not for this country . <&&&> How about traveler's insurance ? I heard Rose is pregnant . I hope it'll be a boy this time . <&&&> I hope so , too.Rose and her husband have been wanting a boy so much . <&&&> After three baby girls in a row , Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws.They want a boy in the worst way now . <&&&> But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys . OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? <&&&> Almost , let me just put my apron on . <&&&> OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . How do you usually part your hair ? Hey , Mary , what's up ? <&&&> Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . <&&&> Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? <&&&> Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . <&&&> It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? <&&&> There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . <&&&> Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . Hi , taxi.Could you take me to the financial street , please <&&&> Pardon , where to , sir ? <&&&> I want to go to the financial stree . <&&&> All right . Hop in , please . <&&&> Excuse me , how long does it take to get there ? <&&&> It usually takes about half an hour . <&&&> Oh , does it really a long way to go . <&&&> Yes . Moreover , since the street is heavy with traffic this time of day . I'm not sure we can make it . By the way , are you pressed for the time ? <&&&> No , I'm not.you can just drive slowly and carefully . <&&&> OK . <&&&> You are very skillful driver . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> By the way , is the fair the same for any distance ? <&&&> No .

Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ? <&&&> Yes . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ? <&&&> Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 .

May I have your name , please ? <&&&> It's John . if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? <&&&> why ? Did tom pop the question ? <&&&> not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . <&&&> let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? <&&&> you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . <&&&> I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . <&&&> oh , how did you deal with it ? <&&&> I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . <&&&> oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? <&&&> simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . <&&&> like what ? have you ever thought about your ideal home ? Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! <&&&> Are you trying to lose weight ? <&&&> Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . <&&&> You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . <&&&> Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? <&&&> Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . <&&&> So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? What are you waiting for ? Get on that bus quickly . Did you take the written test ? Hello . I would like to buy some business cards . <&&&> Excellent . How many would you like ? <&&&> Two thousand would be fine . <&&&> You need to fill out this form , please . <&&&> All I want is the same thing on this card . Will you be done doing my hair soon ? <&&&> Give me a little while longer . <&&&> How much time do you need ? <&&&> There you go . How do you like it ? <&&&> I think it looks gorgeous . <&&&> You think it looks nice ? <&&&> I honestly think it looks great . <&&&> Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job . <&&&> How much is it for my hair ? <&&&> Just give me $ 55 . We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? <&&&> No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? <&&&> What about a factory tour ? <&&&> You mean visit a factory ? <&&&> Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . <&&&> Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? <&&&> I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . How was your trip to America ? <&&&> We had a fantastic time . <&&&> Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? I really want to make a salad . <&&&> Do you know what kind of salad that you want ? <&&&> I'm not sure what kind that I want . <&&&> I usually make a Caesar salad . <&&&> Those taste really good . <&&&> Which kind of salad are you going to make ? Your prices seem a little high . <&&&> We could make it lower for you . What's your counter-offer ? How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ? <&&&> I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview . <&&&> That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . <&&&> It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship . <&&&> We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . <&&&> Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . <&&&> We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information . What are the seasons like in your city ? <&&&> Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . <&&&> Does it ever rain in summer ? <&&&> We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . <&&&> What are spring and autumn like ? <&&&> I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . What are the seasons like in you city ? <&&&> Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot . Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city . <&&&> Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? <&&&> No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . Is this taxi taken ? <&&&> No , madam.May I help you ? <&&&> Yes.Will you take me to the station ? What are you doing ? <&&&> I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . <&&&> There are no countries marked on the map . <&&&> No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . <&&&> The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . <&&&> I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . <&&&> Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you . <&&&> The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . What do you think of the play showed last night ? <&&&> I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy . <&&&> Yes , I turned it off when the fight got heated in it . By the way , can you tell me where I can find a restaurant not ? <&&&> As far as I can see , Westlake Restaurant is a good choice .

Did you have a good time on this vacation ? <&&&> Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . How's it going ? <&&&> I'm in a good mood today , actually .

I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ? <&&&> Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale .

It ’ s on sale , isn't it ? <&&&> Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . <&&&> I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room .

I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? How many languages can you speak ? <&&&> I can speak French and German . <&&&> How well can you speak them ? Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us . <&&&> Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time . <&&&> It doesn't matter . But I really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time . <&&&> What did you do last weekend ? <&&&> It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano . <&&&> Did you play football with other children ? <&&&> Ahh , I was not available last Sunday . I was too busy almost as much as you . <&&&> Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . Good day , what can I do for you ? <&&&> Could you fill me in on the details for buying foreign currency ? <&&&> Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ? <&&&> Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia . Hello , can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I wanna buy a skirt . <&&&> What color and what style do you like ? <&&&> I am not sure . <&&&> Well , you can have a look at our skirts hanging there . <&&&> Ok , thank you . That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? What kind of personality do you think you have ? <&&&> I am very active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done . <&&&> Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? <&&&> I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people . <&&&> What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? <&&&> I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the happier I am . <&&&> Do you have any friend you would call really close ones ? <&&&> Yes , I would call three of my former classmates really close friends . We often get together and talk with each other . Whenever I counter difficulties , they are always ready to give me a hand . There ’ s a letter here for you . <&&&> Let me see it . <&&&> What ’ s the letter about ? <&&&> It ’ s a letter from NYU . <&&&> Tell me what it says ! <&&&> I didn ’ t get in . There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms . <&&&> What are those ? <&&&> They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . <&&&> Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? <&&&> Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? <&&&> I don ’ t really mind . Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . <&&&> Wow , what a great burd ! <&&&> She sure knows how to strut her stuff . <&&&> She's a real turn-on our rights . <&&&> And look out she's dressed . I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . <&&&> Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . <&&&> Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? <&&&> It's fashionable . <&&&> Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . So do you believe in palmistry ? <&&&> Palmistry ? What is that ? <&&&> It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . <&&&> Oh , you mean palm reading . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . <&&&> Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm .

I want to move on . <&&&> Have you decided ? <&&&> Yes , I want to get a better job . <&&&> Could you tell me why you want to quit ? Are you Elvin ? <&&&> Elvin Dixon . Who are you ?

Mom , am I like a superman ? All I need is a cape . <&&&> No , just a super-boy . <&&&> Mom , you always think of me as a child . <&&&> Yes , because a real man doesn't need Mom to worry about him so much . He can do things by himself . <&&&> Sure ! <&&&> Oh , my poor Danny , sure , you are a man . But you know , running like this in street is very dangerous . <&&&> Superman is not afraid of any danger . <&&&> Do you remember the rules of road safety ? <&&&> What ? <&&&> Walk the sidewalk and please right-hand side .

I see from your application form that you ’ Ve worked as a maintenance man for over 7 years . <&&&> yes , that ’ s true . <&&&> what kind of work did you do ? <&&&> I fixed many kinds of machine tools such as milling machines , grinders , welders , etc . I also repaired other things such as vacuums , toilets , locks , etc . I also did some electrical work . I took some courses about electrical systems . <&&&> That ’ s good . What kind of electrical work did you do ? <&&&> I took care of commercial and residential coolers and heaters . I fixed many kinds of power failure problems . Some co-workers and I even rewired part of a building . <&&&> well , your work experience sounds good for the job we have open . Now tell me about the best job you ’ Ve ever had , please . <&&&> the best job ? What do you mean ? <&&&> like the job you feel the most proud of . <&&&> I think my favorite job so far was when I worked for Linaria . It was hard work but the people on my job crew were great to work with . We really worked as a team . I enjoy working with those people . <&&&> Tell me something about a time when you did something well , something you feel proud of . <&&&> I fixed a big problem with a machine and saved a lot of money for the factory . I got bonus for it . I just got fired . I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room . <&&&> Yes . I've got a small room . <&&&> How much is it ? <&&&> 200 Yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed . <&&&> OK . Can I see the room now ? Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? <&&&> Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . <&&&> What was that ? <&&&> Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . <&&&> Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . <&&&> Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . <&&&> I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! <&&&> He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! <&&&> Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . How old are you , Su ? Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . <&&&> How often do you run your anti-virus program ? <&&&> I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . <&&&> Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? <&&&> How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . <&&&> That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . <&&&> Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? <&&&> He ’ s nearly 90 . <&&&> Good gracious ! Are you sure ? Why are you leaving your present job ? <&&&> I ’ m not so satisfied with it . <&&&> Why do you plan to change your job ? <&&&> I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job . <&&&> Why are you interested in working with this company ? I'm not a VIP . You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? <&&&> Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . <&&&> It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... We need to figure out how much money we ’ re spending and what we ’ re spending it on . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Well , I think we could be saving more . <&&&> Really , well , o . k . Get the receipts out . <&&&> Let ’ s see . We spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment , $ 400 on groceries , $ 75 on utilities , $ 250 on gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 300 on entertainment last month . <&&&> That ’ s $ 1825 . <&&&> We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . Would you mind helping us take a picture ? <&&&> My pleasure . How do you want me to do it ? Please come in , Steven . <&&&> All right , Mr . Green . <&&&> Have a seat over there . How are things going out in the office ? <&&&> Pretty well . Everyone is working hard . <&&&> But , our business has been going down sharply the couple of months and we have to reduce some staff . <&&&> You mean I'm among the people who have to go ? <&&&> I'm afraid so . <&&&> Did I do something wrong ? Do you do morning exercises ? <&&&> Yes . I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up . <&&&> Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ? Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? <&&&> I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . <&&&> I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to have a look at the 2 - piece suit . <&&&> What size do you wear ? <&&&> Middle size Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . <&&&> Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? <&&&> To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . <&&&> That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? <&&&> After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? <&&&> Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . <&&&> While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . <&&&> You sure have a lot of discs here . <&&&> Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . <&&&> To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? <&&&> Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . Hello . <&&&> Hello , Claire . This is Mick . <&&&> Mick ! Nice to hear from you again . How are you ? <&&&> Fine , thanks . And you ? That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . <&&&> Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? <&&&> 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . <&&&> Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . <&&&> Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . <&&&> Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? <&&&> All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . <&&&> Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? <&&&> Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . Gongshan Development Co . , Ltd.may I help you ? Good morning , Mr . Huang . It's a pleasure to meet you again . <&&&> Pleased to see you . Welcome to our company . I hope you have a good day . <&&&> Thank you . Can I meet my colleagues ? <&&&> Sure , come with me .

I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . <&&&> I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . <&&&> I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . <&&&> That's because it's full . <&&&> But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . <&&&> Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? <&&&> My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . <&&&> Alright . And what is your major ? <&&&> I'm a comparative literature major . <&&&> Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? <&&&> Yes , that's right . Do you know which stop we get off at ? <&&&> We still have more to go , I think . <&&&> We've been on this bus for a while now . <&&&> You're right . <&&&> Should we have gotten off the bus already ? <&&&> I don't think so . <&&&> I thought you knew . <&&&> Maybe we did miss our stop . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> I'm positive that we missed our stop . How was your date recently ? <&&&> Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . <&&&> I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . <&&&> She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . Is there a problem , officer ? <&&&> Did you notice that stop sign you ran through ? <&&&> I'm sorry , I didn't even notice it . <&&&> You didn't see it ? <&&&> I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it . <&&&> That's true . Those bushes are a problem . <&&&> I swear that I didn't mean to run it . I really love this meal . <&&&> Thanks . I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal . <&&&> Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ? <&&&> I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes . <&&&> The chicken is out of this world ! <&&&> I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . <&&&> I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . <&&&> Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . Excuse me , sir . <&&&> Yes ? <&&&> Is this your car ? <&&&> Yes , it is . <&&&> I'm afraid you've parked on a double yellow line , sir . May I help you ? <&&&> I'm looking for a pair of shoes . Can I help you find something ? <&&&> I would like to buy a new fridge . <&&&> Is there one in particular that you like ? <&&&> I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator . <&&&> Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . <&&&> What's so great about it ? <&&&> It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . <&&&> What appliances ? <&&&> It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . What sports do you like to play ?

What present should we give him this time ? By the way , how old is he ? <&&&> Thirteen today and tomorrow . Fourteen the day after tomorrow . <&&&> How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now . <&&&> And don ’ t forget Mary , Tom ’ s twin sister . It ’ s her birthday , too . Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds . I called about that ad we saw in the paper . <&&&> For the bank manager ? Slow down ! You can't exceed the speed limits . <&&&> No , I cann't . I'm in a hurry ! Good afternoon , how can I help ? <&&&> Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company .

What's wrong with you ? <&&&> I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow . <&&&> Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . <&&&> I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . <&&&> It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . <&&&> I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . <&&&> It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . <&&&> Can I mail the book if it is a large file ? <&&&> There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB . <&&&> What if it exceeds the capacity ? This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? <&&&> Yes .

I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . <&&&> Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? <&&&> No , why ? <&&&> My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . <&&&> She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I would like to look at some watch . <&&&> May I show you the gold ones ? <&&&> Pure gold ones , please . <&&&> OK . Here they are . <&&&> What is the price for this one ? <&&&> One thousand yuan . <&&&> That's quite steep . Can you come down a little bit ? <&&&> I'm afraid not .

I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! <&&&> What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? <&&&> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . <&&&> And ? <&&&> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . <&&&> And it's a brick ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? <&&&> I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . <&&&> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . <&&&> Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it !

It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . <&&&> I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . <&&&> Perhaps we need to have more babies !

Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . <&&&> So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . <&&&> No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . <&&&> What if I don't know the title of the book ? <&&&> Well , you can look under the author's name .

Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . <&&&> Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . <&&&> A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . <&&&> But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? <&&&> My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis .

Are there many idioms in English ? <&&&> There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . <&&&> Can you give us an example ? <&&&> I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . <&&&> What about the expression Goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? how's it going ? <&&&> I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? <&&&> to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . <&&&> what's wrong ? Wow , it has a balcony . <&&&> Yeah .

I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . <&&&> They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . <&&&> They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want . In foreign trade , language differences are very important . <&&&> Yes .

I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . <&&&> Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ? <&&&> We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . I think you will be interested in some of our new products . We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers . <&&&> We're thinking of ordering some special styles of summer clothes . We should be interested in your products if they are of the styles we want . <&&&> As you know , we also take orders for clothes made according to specifications . So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ? <&&&> Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! <&&&> So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? <&&&> Yes . One bedroom is for my wife and I . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen . <&&&> What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . <&&&> That ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . <&&&> Are the rooms nice and bright ? <&&&> Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . I have to move . <&&&> You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet . <&&&> I can ’ t stay here anymore . <&&&> There ’ s a problem with that . <&&&> What is the problem ? <&&&> I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> This was stated in our agreement . <&&&> But I need it back . I immigrated here last year . <&&&> What do you do ? How's it going ? <&&&> I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? <&&&> To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . <&&&> What's wrong ? <&&&> There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . <&&&> I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? <&&&> Sure , but how ? <&&&> You can ask her out for drink after work . <&&&> But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . <&&&> Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . <&&&> Easier said than done . <&&&> You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . I need to eat something . <&&&> You just ate . Hi Anna , come in . <&&&> Wow , your apartment is a mess . <&&&> I know , I didn't have time to put things away before you got here . <&&&> Look ! Are those all your clothes on the couch ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Are they clean ? Where do you live ? <&&&> I live in Beijing . <&&&> What's your permanent address ? <&&&> My permanent address is Apt . 401 , 238 Zhongshan Road , Beijing . <&&&> Where is your birthplace ? <&&&> My birthplace is Suzhou . Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! <&&&> What ? What did you buy ? <&&&> It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! <&&&> What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? <&&&> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . <&&&> And ? <&&&> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . <&&&> And it's a brick ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? <&&&> I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . <&&&> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . <&&&> Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . <&&&> But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? <&&&> He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . <&&&> Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! Acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview . <&&&> Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment . <&&&> We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable . <&&&> Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places . <&&&> We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview . <&&&> In the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview . <&&&> Don't forget to say " Thank you " when you take a seat . <&&&> Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . <&&&> You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way .

A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . <&&&> We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ? <&&&> I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms . <&&&> So let's go and catch earth worms ! <&&&> OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . <&&&> Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing . <&&&> That's because you're talking to me all the time .

I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! <&&&> But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . <&&&> Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . <&&&> Ok . Anything else ? <&&&> Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open .

His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . <&&&> what seems to be the problem ? You're so witty ... <&&&> So why is the face tilted to the right ? <&&&> This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . <&&&> So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? <&&&> It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . <&&&> I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... Good afternoon , madam .

The first time , I was in a car accident . <&&&> Is your boss Chinese ? <&&&> No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going .

What should I do ? Do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? <&&&> No , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something .

I'd put a coat on if I were you . <&&&> It wasn't cold out this morning . <&&&> Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! <&&&> Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . <&&&> Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? <&&&> It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . <&&&> That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . <&&&> Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . <&&&> How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? <&&&> I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . <&&&> Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . <&&&> I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? <&&&> Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . <&&&> That sounds like fun .

I'm not sure if we will be eligible . <&&&> This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . <&&&> So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ?

Have you ever used it ? <&&&> no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . <&&&> yes , I guess I should try to use it . <&&&> does it have a camera ? <&&&> of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? <&&&> I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . <&&&> sure . Here you go . <&&&> have you checked your voicemail recently ? <&&&> no , why ? <&&&> I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . <&&&> oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . <&&&> do you want to listen to your messages first ? <&&&> no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . <&&&> I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . <&&&> I'm surprised you know so much about it .

Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? <&&&> well , you are a very hard-worker . <&&&> I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . <&&&> there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? <&&&> I could really use a 5 % rise . Mary , today is a great day for you . Good morning . My name is John Smith . I'm an import manager . <&&&> How do you do , Mr . Smith ? My name is Thou Hong . <&&&> Nice to meet You , Ms . Thou . We've learned that you specialize in the export of electronic products . <&&&> Will you please take a seat ? Mr . Smith , have you seen the display of our electronic products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? <&&&> Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we <&&&> Sure we can . You know , we've been in this line for more than twenty years . <&&&> So , Ms . Thou , we're a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over America . <&&&> Good . We can hold more talks later on to iron out the details . Mom , may I play the card games for a while ? <&&&> Do you ? Dad is in the study . <&&&> I won't make any noise . Mom , please . <&&&> Behave yourself ! Don't make any noise . Have you finished your homework ? <&&&> Yes , I ' Ve finished . <&&&> Then let me see . <&&&> er ... , mom , I promise . I won't make a single noise . <&&&> All right . Just five minutes . Be sure not to touch anything . <&&&> Ok . I won't get into trouble . <&&&> Be careful ! I'm looking for a necklace for my girl friend as a birthday present . <&&&> You've come to the right store .

And my forehead is burning . <&&&> You said you never went to hospital . <&&&> I will get better soon . <&&&> The good thing is you don't need to go to school . <&&&> Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams . <&&&> And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for . Liz , do you have a minute ? <&&&> Yes , of course . What is it ? <&&&> I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning . <&&&> Okay , what should I do ? <&&&> Well , it isn't at this office . It's over at the Dayton Street office.Have you been there before ? <&&&> Yes , of course . I have to go there every Tuesday . Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . <&&&> How many credits for each course ? <&&&> Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . What's going on ? <&&&> Nothing really , you ? Is there a problem , officer ? <&&&> Did you notice that stop sign you ran through ? Please take a seat . <&&&> Thanks . <&&&> Now what can I do for you ? <&&&> Well , I'm looking for a job . <&&&> Fine , but first I need some information about you . <&&&> What kind of information do you want ? <&&&> Well , first of all , your name.What ' s your surname ? <&&&> Wilson . <&&&> And your other names ?

You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? <&&&> Come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at it , it's beautiful ! <&&&> When you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . <&&&> Maybe you have a point . <&&&> Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . <&&&> All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! <&&&> That's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . <&&&> Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . good morning ! <&&&> good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? <&&&> I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! <&&&> that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . <&&&> I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . <&&&> what's that ? <&&&> well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . <&&&> that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . <&&&> for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? <&&&> just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . <&&&> Ok , I'll try that . Have you got anything for diarrhea ? <&&&> Yes , here you are . These tablets are very effective . Hi Mary , how's it going ? <&&&> well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! <&&&> What are you so excited about ? <&&&> I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! I would love to rent out your apartment . <&&&> That ’ s great . <&&&> How much is the rent ? <&&&> The rent each month is $ 1050 . <&&&> That ’ s a lot of money . <&&&> Did you have a better price in mind ? <&&&> What about $ 800 ? <&&&> That ’ s way too low .

Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . <&&&> Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ? what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? <&&&> I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? <&&&> I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . <&&&> I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . Do you take a bus to and from work ? <&&&> Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction . How may I help you . sir ? <&&&> I'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket . I just lost my ticket for Beijing tonight . <&&&> Let me see . I'm sorry . Nothing's been turned in . Do you want to buy another one ? <&&&> Yes . If I don ' t make it to Beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . How much does it cost ? <&&&> 150 yuan for hard seats . How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? <&&&> No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . <&&&> I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . Jack , do say good-bye for me to the host . I've got to run . <&&&> Why are you in such a hurry ? <&&&> My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p . m . Bye ! Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? <&&&> Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . You have a lovely house , Jack . Excuse me , do you speak English ? <&&&> Yes , do you need some help ? <&&&> Actually , yes . Could you show me how to use my key card ? <&&&> Yes , sure . You need to put your card in the slot . <&&&> Ok , like this ? Hey , the pool's open now ! <&&&> As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . <&&&> So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... <&&&> ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . <&&&> Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . What shall we do after the volleyball match ? <&&&> How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . <&&&> That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . <&&&> Me , too . What did you have in mind ? <&&&> I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . <&&&> I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan <&&&> Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? <&&&> The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . <&&&> Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . <&&&> Why would that be funny ? <&&&> Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . Currently we are looking for business opportunities in northeast China . <&&&> What kind of business do you do ? <&&&> We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties . The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? <&&&> No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? <&&&> It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . <&&&> I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . How did you get into hip hop ? Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . <&&&> Thanks ! <&&&> Are you applying to study or work abroad ? <&&&> I want to study abroad . <&&&> What do you want to study ? <&&&> I hope to study English literature . <&&&> Have you got your visa yet ? <&&&> Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today . <&&&> I see . Is it your first interview ? <&&&> No , I've already been to here for three interviews . Hello , I'm returning your phone call . <&&&> I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast . <&&&> No problem , but what were you calling about ? <&&&> I needed to talk to you about your son . <&&&> Is he messing up in school ? <&&&> He was acting up in class one day last week . <&&&> What was he doing ? <&&&> He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class . <&&&> I don't know what's gotten into him . <&&&> If you could , would you please talk to him ? Hey , how's it going ? <&&&> Good . How about you ? <&&&> Not bad , thanks for asking . <&&&> Have you been on the bus for a while ? <&&&> Only about fifteen minutes . <&&&> Do you ride this bus often ? <&&&> Not really , I usually drive . <&&&> You have a car ? <&&&> Yes , I do . Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... <&&&> If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . <&&&> Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... <&&&> It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . What musical instrument do you play ? <&&&> I can play the piano a bit . <&&&> Then we can have one more program at our party ? Are you paid on a commission or salary basis now ? <&&&> I'm paid on a salary . <&&&> What's your monthly salary ? <&&&> At present I get 1,800 yuan per month . <&&&> How much do you hope to get a month here ? <&&&> That's not the problem I care about .

They must really be committed to staff development . What am I supposed to do with this plastic cup ? <&&&> That cup is for a urine sample . <&&&> How , exactly , does this work ? <&&&> This particular test calls for you to urinate into the cup after you have urinated a little into the toilet . <&&&> When I finish , what should I do then ? <&&&> You need to leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom , and the lab tech will get it from the other side . <&&&> What is my doctor testing me for ? <&&&> If there are bacteria in your urine , it could mean an infection somewhere . <&&&> Will I know the results right away ?

I came here to study political science . <&&&> How do you like it ? <&&&> I like it so far . But my English still needs work . <&&&> I want to study Mandarin and international relations . <&&&> Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? <&&&> They teach regular characters . <&&&> I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . <&&&> You just said your English needs work , yes ? <&&&> Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . <&&&> Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . <&&&> You mean you and I ? First you add the washing powder then you add the clothes . <&&&> I take it you've done this before ? The Canada Day is on the 1st of July . Daniel , I can't catch up with the English teacher very well . <&&&> What's the problem ? <&&&> You are quite good at English , can you help me with it .

Do you have anything recommended ? <&&&> OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . <&&&> Hey , How did you know I came from America ? Well , what's the matter with you ? <&&&> I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . <&&&> Have you got a headache ? <&&&> Yes , I ache all over .

I'm rather round of it . <&&&> It's delicious . <&&&> What sort of western food do you like best ? <&&&> I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? Mom , I'm starving . <&&&> Here are some biscuits . Why are you back so early today ? <&&&> My teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . You ? <&&&> Me what ? <&&&> You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . <&&&> It's not for us . <&&&> Then it's for Dad , isn't it ? It's so unfair ! <&&&> Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang . <&&&> What was that again ? <&&&> It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card . <&&&> Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute . <&&&> Do you know about the Bucky Card ? <&&&> I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . <&&&> The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . <&&&> What about beer ? <&&&> The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . <&&&> That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? <&&&> Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . <&&&> And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? Joseph , who is that woman ? <&&&> That's Susan . <&&&> What does she do for work ? <&&&> She's a lawyer . Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road.Please roll down your window . <&&&> What's the matter , sir ? <&&&> Have you been drinking ? <&&&> No , I haven't sir . <&&&> Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . <&&&> But , sir , I didn't drink at all . <&&&> If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment . <&&&> OK . I'll blow . <&&&> Your BAC exceeds the legal limit . <&&&> But I ... Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? <&&&> Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy . Do you offer a course in business management ? <&&&> Yes , we do . <&&&> How many nights a week is it ? <&&&> It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . <&&&> And how long does the course last ? <&&&> It lasts for 9 months . <&&&> When does it start ? Hello Michael . <&&&> Hello Todd . Hello I ’ Ve just take out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? <&&&> Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . <&&&> I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary . <&&&> That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . <&&&> I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . <&&&> I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? Do you know which bus will take me from PHS to Sons ? <&&&> Which Sons do you want to go to ? <&&&> It's on Fair Oaks and Orange Grove . <&&&> You actually need to catch two buses . Fred , we're gonna have a meeting after half an hour . Have you got it ? <&&&> Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company . <&&&> Hush ! The wall has ears , you know . <&&&> But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy . <&&&> My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it . <&&&> What's the meeting for ? <&&&> It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year . Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! Come on in . Let me show you around . Here ’ s the living room . <&&&> Great . The view from this window is wonderful . I think I may rent this apartment from you . <&&&> That ’ s great to hear . <&&&> How much are you looking to rent it for ? <&&&> For each month you would have to pay $ 1050 . <&&&> That is too expensive . <&&&> I don ’ t think that is too much for rent . <&&&> How does $ 850 a month sound to you ? <&&&> That ’ s not enough . Excuse me , but I ’ m a bit lost here . Where does this street lead to ? I have to move . <&&&> You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet . <&&&> I can ’ t stay here anymore . <&&&> There ’ s a problem with that . <&&&> What is the problem ? <&&&> I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit . Mr . : Hello , Mary . <&&&> Hi . <&&&> Mr . : I'm Mr . Taylor , and I'm your counselor . I'm going to show you around the school . Can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to buy a tie to match this suit . <&&&> We have various colors . How about this one ? You look pale today . <&&&> I didn't wear make-up this morning . Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! <&&&> What are you so excited about ? <&&&> I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! <&&&> What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . <&&&> I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . You are quite busy every day . Is this your brother-in-law ? Do you want a cigarette ? <&&&> No , thank you . I've given up , you know . <&&&> You don't mind if I have one . <&&&> Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . <&&&> Yes , you are right . <&&&> Why don't you try and give it up ? the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? <&&&> I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . <&&&> where are you planning on going ? <&&&> I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? <&&&> I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . <&&&> would you recommend going there for a few days ? <&&&> personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . <&&&> you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? <&&&> it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? <&&&> I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . Why don't you watch where you're going ? <&&&> Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! <&&&> There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . <&&&> Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . <&&&> I think my arm is broken . <&&&> Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . <&&&> Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . <&&&> Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . <&&&> I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? <&&&> Alright . Look ! There's even a built-in handle to carry it with . <&&&> But it's so thin . There's no way that it comes with a CD-ROM . <&&&> Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in ! <&&&> What other features are listed ? <&&&> It says that it comes in teal and tangerine . <&&&> Totally cool colors ! I don't understand why I'm being arrested . <&&&> You have a warrant . <&&&> A warrant for what ? <&&&> Apparently , you have a bench warrant . <&&&> What does that mean ? <&&&> You missed a court appearance . <&&&> I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . <&&&> I don't know what to tell you . <&&&> I don't find this fair . <&&&> Life isn't fair . Francis , what ’ s that ? <&&&> Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . <&&&> Could you tell me something about it ? <&&&> Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . Have you heard the news ? <&&&> I haven't heard anything . <&&&> Deborah had her baby last week . <&&&> Nobody told me . <&&&> I thought you heard . <&&&> I really wasn't told anything . <&&&> She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? <&&&> Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . <&&&> Brad Bush ? Good for you ! <&&&> But I don't know what to do . Your dog is really cute . What's his name ? <&&&> His name is Bingo . <&&&> What kind of dog is he ? <&&&> We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away . <&&&> Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ? <&&&> Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . <&&&> That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws . <&&&> I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ? <&&&> About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though . <&&&> Really ? Why is that ? <&&&> She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time . Steven , what's the expense of moving house ? <&&&> About 3 000 dollars . <&&&> It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ? <&&&> I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . I am kind of nervous . <&&&> Nervous ? Why ? <&&&> I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . <&&&> Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . <&&&> Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . <&&&> Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . <&&&> Alright . But will we sing ? <&&&> Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . They must be your parents , what do they do ? <&&&> My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . <&&&> Do they often take you out ? Well , it was nice talking to you . <&&&> It was nice talking to you too . <&&&> We should really hang out again . <&&&> That would be fun . A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? <&&&> I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? <&&&> Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . <&&&> Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . <&&&> Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . How was your shopping trip Martin ? <&&&> Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . <&&&> Oh really ? Did you find any bargains ? <&&&> I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops . <&&&> And how did you get around town ? What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? <&&&> I'm planing to go balling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? <&&&> I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . <&&&> Why not ? Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes , could you tell me if there is a laundry in this hotel ? <&&&> yes , It ’ s on the third floor <&&&> Thank you very much . What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me ! <&&&> Where does it hurt the most ? <&&&> Right here ! It hurts right here ! <&&&> How long has it felt like this ? <&&&> I felt OK when I woke up , and then , suddenly , I had this really sharp pain . So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? <&&&> Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? <&&&> I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . We have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list . I would like to order a suit made to my own measure . <&&&> I share the same opinion . You are over-weight so it's hard for you to buy clothes . <&&&> Maybe I should try to lose weight . Where are you going ? I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . <&&&> They have moved to Chicago . What's wrong with you , young man ? <&&&> Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache . Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . <&&&> You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . <&&&> Are you serious ? How can that be ? <&&&> Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . <&&&> Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . <&&&> That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! <&&&> Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! <&&&> You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . <&&&> Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . <&&&> Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? <&&&> Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . <&&&> What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . <&&&> Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . What course did you like best ? Excuse me . I was wondering how to order office supplies . <&&&> We have a requisition form on the company web site . What type of supplies do you need ? <&&&> I need paper , ink cartridges , and paper clips . Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited ! Wow , it has a balcony . <&&&> Yeah . Complete with nice of you . <&&&> How many windows are there in the apartment ? <&&&> Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen . Do I often have to work overtime ? Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . <&&&> What can I do for you ? <&&&> I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? <&&&> Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . <&&&> Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . <&&&> I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . What did the doctor say ? do you have any plans for Friday night ? <&&&> I don't think so . Why ? <&&&> well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ? <&&&> sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ? <&&&> the more , the merrier ! <&&&> will there be a lot of people there ? What are you doing ? <&&&> I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay . <&&&> You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd ! <&&&> Why ? I don ’ t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ’ m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy . <&&&> I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ? <&&&> Well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy . <&&&> Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ? <&&&> You can use a credit card or your debit card . They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast . I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything . Hey , Mary , what's up ? <&&&> Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . <&&&> Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? <&&&> Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . <&&&> It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? <&&&> There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . <&&&> Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . <&&&> What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? <&&&> The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot <&&&> Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . May I help you , sir ? <&&&> I want a pair of locus . Hi , Helen . Where are you going on this summer vacation ? <&&&> I'm going to Disneyland . Were you born in the U . S . , Melissa ? <&&&> No , I wasn't . I came here in 1992 . <&&&> How old were you ? Excuse me , I got a parcel arrival notice yesterday . I need to find somewhere to park . <&&&> Off campus or on campus ? <&&&> I need to find a space on campus . <&&&> Why don't you park in the parking structure for students ? <&&&> Where is the parking structure at ? <&&&> It's on the west side of the campus . <&&&> Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ? <&&&> It was empty last time I went up there . <&&&> How long ago was that ? <&&&> I went up there early this morning . Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes . Fill it up , please . <&&&> OK . What kind of gas do you want ? <&&&> I don't really know . I have just bought this new car . And it's the first time I've gotten gas for it . <&&&> We have regular , super , and premium gasoline . This is a new car , so I'd recommend premium . <&&&> Premium , please . Thanks . Please fill it up . <&&&> All right , sir . You will park at refueling 4 . <&&&> OK , thanks . <&&&> Your car's ready . Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? <&&&> Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . <&&&> What was that ? <&&&> Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . <&&&> Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . <&&&> Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . <&&&> I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! <&&&> He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! <&&&> Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . <&&&> How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? <&&&> Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? <&&&> Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... <&&&> ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... <&&&> Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? <&&&> Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . Mr . Thomas is making a long-distance call . Please wait for a few minutes . Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . <&&&> Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . <&&&> Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . I have read your notice on the wall so I come to see if there is anything I need . <&&&> Well take your time . There are so many things to sell . <&&&> How much is the desk ? <&&&> $ 7 . Good afternoon , sales department.May I help you ? <&&&> Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ? So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? <&&&> Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . <&&&> You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? <&&&> Actually it will be my first time to meet her . <&&&> You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . <&&&> That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . <&&&> Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . <&&&> The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . What would you reckon the taxing increases ? <&&&> Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . <&&&> But what do most people think about it ? Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? <&&&> No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . <&&&> Where do they go ? Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? <&&&> Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . <&&&> Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . <&&&> Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . <&&&> Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? <&&&> Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . <&&&> Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? <&&&> You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . <&&&> It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . <&&&> Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . <&&&> It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . <&&&> But we need the wood . How are you doing ? <&&&> I'm doing great . <&&&> What movies have you seen lately ? <&&&> I saw Forrest Gump the other day . <&&&> What type of movie is that ? <&&&> The movie type is drama . <&&&> I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . <&&&> I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . <&&&> What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? <&&&> I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . <&&&> Out of those what is your favorite ? <&&&> My favorite is to play computer games . <&&&> What is your favorite computer game ? <&&&> My favorite is Diablo .

Let me check whether the private room is available or not . No problem . <&&&> It will be for business dinner . Reserve it under the name of Nova , the manager of Fashion Clothes Company .

I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . <&&&> It was me . I am so sorry . <&&&> What did you think you were doing ? Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . <&&&> You might want to try the mangoes . <&&&> Can you describe a mango to me ? <&&&> It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . <&&&> Do I eat the seed ? <&&&> Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . <&&&> What's the price of these mangoes ? <&&&> Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each . <&&&> Tell me what they taste like . Hey , look out ! <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off . <&&&> Where ? my car ?

Did you hear the news ? <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week . <&&&> She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ? <&&&> I would've thought that somebody would have told you . <&&&> No , I had no idea . <&&&> Well , she did , her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . <&&&> Oh my God , that's great ! <&&&> Are you going to go and visit her and the baby ? Hi Benjamin . My name is Dr . Green . What seems to be the matter ? <&&&> I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now . Tell me , what do you enjoy doing in your spare time ? <&&&> I enjoy drawing and painting . <&&&> You know how to draw and paint ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> When did you learn how to do that ? <&&&> I learned back in high school . <&&&> Oh , so you took an art class ? <&&&> Yeah , I loved that art class . <&&&> I see that you're pretty talented . <&&&> Thank you very much . <&&&> I wish I had a talent like that . Shouldn't you already be in bed ? <&&&> I can't sleep . I'm really not all that tired . <&&&> You need to get some rest , as you have to get up early in the morning . Hi , United Airlines ? This is Elizabeth parks calling . I have a reservation on the 2:30 p . m . flight to Shanghai this afternoon . How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? <&&&> At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! <&&&> Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . <&&&> It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . <&&&> Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . <&&&> Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . <&&&> Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? You heard who won the election , right ? What can I do for you ? <&&&> Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation . <&&&> You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . <&&&> I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week . Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? <&&&> Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . <&&&> I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? <&&&> One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! <&&&> When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? <&&&> You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend the <&&&> What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? <&&&> One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out side of your body . What a lovely day , isn't it ? <&&&> Yes , it's nice and bright . <&&&> I hope it stays like this . <&&&> I hope so too . <&&&> Is the weather usually like this here ? <&&&> It's usually a bit hotter than today . <&&&> What's the weather like in winter ? <&&&> It's pretty cold and it often snows . <&&&> I wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow . <&&&> Let's hear the weather report later .

Merry Christmas , Bill ! <&&&> Merry Christmas . Steven ! <&&&> What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? Where were you last night , at exactly 920 pm ? <&&&> 920 pm , I couldn't say . I can't remember . <&&&> Are you sure you can't remember ? <&&&> I'm absolutely certain . <&&&> Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? <&&&> I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . <&&&> Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? <&&&> No , I didn't . <&&&> Sure ? Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? <&&&> Sure , what's up ? <&&&> I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? <&&&> Good question . I have to think about it . Will we drive to the seaside ? <&&&> Yes , it will take about four hours . We can leave about noon and get there by supper time . <&&&> Let me help pay for gas . <&&&> All right . There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third . Hi , Sven , can you help me ? Could you hold the end of the tape measure , please ? <&&&> Of course , where do you want me to stand ? <&&&> Just there by the door . I need to measure the length of this workbench . We're going to replace it . OK - 3 m 47 cm . Let's round it up to 3 m 50 . <&&&> I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? This facility is great , don't you think ? <&&&> Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . <&&&> I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . <&&&> If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . <&&&> Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . <&&&> Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? <&&&> No . <&&&> That's strange . <&&&> Where do you go for lunch around here ? <&&&> Are you hungry ? Something's wrong with my computer . <&&&> Exactly what ? <&&&> All I get is a black screen . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> I think I know , because this happened before . <&&&> What happened before ? <&&&> My hard drive crashed . <&&&> Oh , no . That's bad news . <&&&> It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure . Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? <&&&> Yes , I did , Ms . Chen . <&&&> That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . <&&&> Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . <&&&> You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? The weather is really miserable . It has been raining hard all day long . <&&&> Yes , it's so cold . <&&&> Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ? <&&&> Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon . <&&&> How long does the rainy season last ? <&&&> About two months . <&&&> I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much . Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ? Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . <&&&> Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . <&&&> Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . how was your education going on in Australia ? <&&&> I'm going to graduate this summer . <&&&> where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? <&&&> I'm planning to return to China after graduation . <&&&> why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . <&&&> well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . <&&&> yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . <&&&> Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . <&&&> I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself . <&&&> Sure , what gives ? <&&&> Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class ! Hello . I am Bili and I made an appointment with you to see the house . <&&&> Glad to meet you . This way , please . I'm going to need a taxi . <&&&> You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi . We can offer you a private vehicle . Which school are you attending ? <&&&> I am attending Hebes University of Technology . <&&&> When will you graduate from that university ? <&&&> This coming July . It's time for you to wake up . <&&&> Give me five more minutes . I'm really tired this morning . <&&&> I'm sorry , but it's time for you to get ready for school . <&&&> I get that , but let me just sleep for a little bit longer . May I help you ? <&&&> My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . <&&&> Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? <&&&> Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? <&&&> Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . <&&&> The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? <&&&> Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . Good afternoon . Can I help you ? <&&&> Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ? <&&&> I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ? What can I do for you ? <&&&> I would like to open another account . <&&&> What kind do you want to open ? <&&&> I want to open a savings account . <&&&> Do you have an account opened with this bank already ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> You can always transfer money from that account into your new one . What should I prepare for the recruitment fair ? <&&&> You should wear a formal dress and be confident . <&&&> What application materials should I take ? Good morning , Miss . <&&&> Morning . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . Happy Birthday , Mary ! <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . <&&&> What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? <&&&> I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . <&&&> Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . <&&&> Really ? It looks so nice . <&&&> Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . <&&&> All right . I ’ Ve just found a mouse in the house ! <&&&> Ow ! Don ’ t shout so loud . Calm down . Please stop shouting and sit quietly down . It ’ s time to get up . <&&&> I just went to bed . <&&&> You shouldn ’ t stay up so late watching TV . I told you we had to get an early start . <&&&> I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I ’ ll just have to pay the price anti-sleepy . <&&&> Do you want to eat breakfast here ? Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? <&&&> I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . <&&&> Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . <&&&> Great .

I want to buy a silk coat . <&&&> this way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade . <&&&> oh , they look nice . May I try that back one on ? <&&&> of course . The fitting room is right over there . Mrs . Lee , I ’ Ve stayed here for almost a week . And I really must leave tomorrow . I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . <&&&> oh . <&&&> don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ? <&&&> sure . <&&&> I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do it get on the train tonight a <&&&> the train ? Will I be flying back then ? <&&&> oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . <&&&> will the train be very crowded ? <&&&> oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . <&&&> when is the first meeting then ? And what's your vision ? <&&&> 20/350 . <&&&> Mine's 20/20 . Life just isn't fair , is it ? <&&&> Oh , yes , it is . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ? Can I help you ? Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? <&&&> Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? <&&&> Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? <&&&> Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . How are your stocks doing , Jim ? <&&&> Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . <&&&> Yeah , I lost money investing in the internet too . <&&&> Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas . <&&&> I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . <&&&> Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Ted ? Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? <&&&> Yes . I've read it carefully . <&&&> And do you have any questions ? <&&&> No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? <&&&> No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . <&&&> But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . <&&&> I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? <&&&> Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? <&&&> I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . <&&&> I can accept that . <&&&> Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . <&&&> Even my health insurance ? <&&&> Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . <&&&> I have a few questions about the free membership . <&&&> What would you like to know ? I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from . There's so much to do and so little time . <&&&> I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ? <&&&> Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium ! <&&&> OK ... and what about the buffet and the cake ? Did your mom call the caterer ? <&&&> All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted . I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . <&&&> Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? <&&&> All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I was looking for a book , but I couldn ’ t find it . <&&&> Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf ? <&&&> I already did . <&&&> Is it on the shelf ? <&&&> I didn ’ t see it . <&&&> Apparently somebody took that book out of the library . <&&&> Will you ever get another copy ? What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! <&&&> I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . <&&&> I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! <&&&> I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? <&&&> I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . <&&&> Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? <&&&> I don't know . <&&&> I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . <&&&> I have plenty of gas . <&&&> Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . <&&&> So what can we do ? <&&&> Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . <&&&> Alright . That's a good idea . <&&&> I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . <&&&> Days ? <&&&> Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . <&&&> Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . Is there a vacant table for two now ? <&&&> Yes , sir , let me show you the table . This way please . <&&&> Well , we would like to sit over there . Is that all right ? He is planning again . Let's go ! Sunshine Hotel . <&&&> Have you got a single room for Monday evening , please ? <&&&> With or without private bathroom ? Hi , I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice . <&&&> Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage . <&&&> I'm afraid that a button is missing . <&&&> I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon . Would you like to order now ? <&&&> This all looks good ! I think we know what we want . <&&&> Please let me point out the chef's special , which is blackened catfish . <&&&> I am dieting , so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce ? How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? <&&&> It ’ s easy , grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . OK . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . <&&&> Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . <&&&> You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . <&&&> OK , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? <&&&> Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . <&&&> I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? <&&&> That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . Do you have a bf ? <&&&> Yes , I had a bf before . <&&&> Why you say bf before ? <&&&> We parted from each other last month . <&&&> Have you got a new one ? <&&&> Mmmm , no . How about you ? Well , Peter . I'm sorry you're ill . What's the matter with you ? Excuse me , which way is to the post office ? Hello Michael . <&&&> Hello Todd . <&&&> We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? <&&&> Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . <&&&> OK . What are the biggest cities ? <&&&> The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? <&&&> Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . <&&&> You are kidding , but she's so helpful . What do you think a job is ? <&&&> Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person . <&&&> Where do you see yourself three years from now ? <&&&> I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . <&&&> That sounds reasonable . <&&&> It's the most important thing to me . <&&&> Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? <&&&> I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss . Good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company . <&&&> Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . <&&&> When did it first break down ? <&&&> About ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . <&&&> Is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . Can I help you , madam ? <&&&> Yes , I'm looking for a new winter coat . <&&&> Have you any particular color in mind ? <&&&> I don't know really . What's the fashional color this year ? <&&&> Red is very popular . <&&&> Good . Red suits me very well . It's a cheerful color , isn't it ? <&&&> Yes , madam , I agree . What size are you ? <&&&> Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen . <&&&> Here you are , madam . All these are sixteens . <&&&> I quite like this one . How much is it ? <&&&> It's $ 180 . <&&&> Oh , that's too expensive . Aren't there any cheaper ones ? You look upset , is there anything wrong ? Excuse me , sir . May I go with you to claim my luggage ? I am a stranger here . <&&&> Sure , I have to go anyway . But the first place you need to go is immigration office . They ’ ll check your ticket , passport , visa and immunization record book . After that we can go to the baggage claim area . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> This is my luggage , but it's too heavy . I can't move it . Could you help me get it out of the conveyer belt ? Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question . What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? <&&&> I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? <&&&> I don't know . I failed my exam . <&&&> What did you get ? <&&&> A B plus . <&&&> That's not bad . <&&&> But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! <&&&> Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? <&&&> No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . <&&&> I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? <&&&> What ? <&&&> You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . <&&&> You look a little lost , can I help you ? <&&&> Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . <&&&> Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties.Have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . <&&&> Sure that ’ s fine.This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ? <&&&> Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? <&&&> Just pick something and get the hell out of here.Um , I'll go with these two.This is mortifying . I just want to get this over with.She better thank me for this ... <&&&> Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . Mary , we're going to the supermarket . Do you want to come ? <&&&> Yeah . I need to get some stuff . <&&&> Let's all go together then . <&&&> Where's Lisa ? <&&&> She's getting coupons from her desk . <&&&> What are coupons ? <&&&> They give you discounts on some stuff that you want to buy . <&&&> Really ? I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it . I ’ Ve been having problems getting onto the Internet . <&&&> Have you checked your connection settings ? <&&&> Yes , they're fine . I suppose.the server might be down again . Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ? <&&&> I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ? <&&&> I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . <&&&> Probably , Rose . That must be the job of nutritionists . <&&&> Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . <&&&> Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . <&&&> Seriously ? <&&&> Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . <&&&> I wouldn't do it if I were you . Excuse me . Nature calls . Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . <&&&> Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . <&&&> Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . <&&&> Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around 16 . <&&&> Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? Do you want black or white coffee ? <&&&> White , please <&&&> Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ? Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . <&&&> What kind of presents do you want ? <&&&> Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? <&&&> OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . <&&&> Hey , How did you know I came from America ? <&&&> Just a hunch , sir . <&&&> How much again ? <&&&> $ 59.95 . <&&&> That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . <&&&> Sorry , sir . <&&&> Why not ? <&&&> Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . <&&&> Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . <&&&> That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . <&&&> DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml . <&&&> It's $ 60 here . I am kind of nervous . <&&&> Nervous ? Why ? <&&&> I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . <&&&> Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . <&&&> Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . <&&&> Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . Are you ready to order , sir ? <&&&> Yes , I'll have tomato soup and my friend will have mushroom soup . <&&&> Do you want anything to go with soup ? Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . <&&&> Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . <&&&> I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . <&&&> Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . <&&&> Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? <&&&> History . <&&&> Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . <&&&> Thirty percent ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? <&&&> Yes . It's an excellent system . <&&&> Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? <&&&> Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . <&&&> I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . <&&&> I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . <&&&> What ? Are you serious ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> But nobody uses Macintosh ! <&&&> That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? <&&&> Yes , I'm from Taiwan . <&&&> Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? <&&&> There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . <&&&> Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . <&&&> Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . <&&&> What is the international community doing to help ? <&&&> The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ? <&&&> To study . I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years . <&&&> And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ? <&&&> Yes , here it is . <&&&> Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ? <&&&> I've got a letter from my bank here . It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies . How can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . <&&&> Did you have anything specific in mind ? Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . <&&&> Thank you very much . <&&&> I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . <&&&> I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . <&&&> Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? <&&&> I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . <&&&> How do you work with a team ? <&&&> I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . <&&&> What ’ s your long term goal ? Help ! Help ! <&&&> What's the trouble , ma'am ? Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! <&&&> So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? <&&&> That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! <&&&> Have you ever written up a business plan before ? How much is it ? <&&&> 6 500 yuan . You will get it on the price tag . <&&&> It s a little overpriced . Is there any discount on this laptop ? <&&&> Its already very cheap . Let's make it 6 000 yuan . What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? <&&&> I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ? <&&&> I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam . I want to start a tradition of family vacations with our family right now before we have kids . <&&&> You want to make sure it's good solid habit before anything else takes its place , like work ? <&&&> Yes , so this year we are going to take our first family vacation , just you and I . <&&&> And where are we going to go ? We need someone rather quickly , the sooner the better . <&&&> Can I ask what the position pays ? <&&&> Well , of course depends somewhat on experience , background and that sort of thing . What are your currently earning ? <&&&> My current salary is in the range of fifty thousand yuan . How long have you been washing clothes here ? Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? <&&&> Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? <&&&> Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . <&&&> That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . <&&&> Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? <&&&> When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . <&&&> I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? <&&&> Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . <&&&> Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . <&&&> Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . <&&&> You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . <&&&> Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? <&&&> For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . <&&&> Hey , young man , you are so deep today . It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . Charlotte , have you had your supper ? What does your sister look like , Mike ? Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? <&&&> Yes , here you go . how's your new job going ? <&&&> really well , thanks . <&&&> how are you finding your new boss ? <&&&> she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . <&&&> would you rather have her or your old boss back ? <&&&> she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . <&&&> how about your new co-workers ? Hi Julie , how are things going ? <&&&> Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? I need to buy a bus pass . <&&&> What kind of bus pass would you like to buy ? <&&&> What are the different kinds ? <&&&> You can get a day , weekly , monthly , or student pass . <&&&> Could I get a student pass , please ? <&&&> Sure , can I see your student ID ? <&&&> Sure , here it is . <&&&> Very good . <&&&> How much for the pass ? <&&&> It's free , but the monthly sticker is $ 24 . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . <&&&> Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . <&&&> Thanks . <&&&> Here you are . You must return them within a month . <&&&> What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there ! I hear you and James are engaged at last . <&&&> Yes , we are . <&&&> When are you getting married ? <&&&> In the spring . Good afternoon , sales department.May I help you ? <&&&> Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ? <&&&> I'll see a piece available , who should I say is calling , please ? <&&&> John eng <&&&> Hold the line , please.Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid.Can I help you ? <&&&> Well , I want to discuss with them the new control we said last week . <&&&> I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free . <&&&> Yes , that will be easiest . I'm glad we live in a small town . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . <&&&> Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? <&&&> Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? <&&&> I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . <&&&> When can you come ? What colour is her hair ? <&&&> Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... <&&&> What , curly ? <&&&> No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . <&&&> Does she wear glasses ? <&&&> No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . <&&&> What is it ? <&&&> It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . Hello , Mr Trent . What can I do for you this afternoon ? Good morning , sir . Can I see your boarding pass , please ? <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . <&&&> Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? I'm glad I brought my jacket on this trip . <&&&> Yes , I didn't know Washington , DC got so cold in winter . <&&&> What would you like to do today ? <&&&> I really think we should take a tour of the White House . <&&&> I thought we could go to some of the museums.Don ' t you want to see the museums ? <&&&> Of course . But today I feel like seeing the White House.We should see it first , because it's the most famous historical building here . David , imagine meeting you here ! <&&&> Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? <&&&> All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers . <&&&> It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning . <&&&> How many vegetables do you steal today ? <&&&> I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm . <&&&> So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . <&&&> I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . Hi , I'm here to check in . <&&&> Would you please fill out this registration 1 form ? <&&&> Thank you ... Excuse me , sir . You forgot to fill in your visa number . I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . <&&&> Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . <&&&> You've had a good trip , I hope . <&&&> Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . <&&&> It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . Welcome to Flash Foot , sir . How can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like extra prints made of these photos . <&&&> Do you have your negatives ? <&&&> Yes . Here they are . I've marked how many prints I want on each shot . <&&&> What size do you want the prints ? <&&&> Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . it's a lovely day , isn't it ? <&&&> yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . <&&&> is she American ? <&&&> yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! <&&&> so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? <&&&> I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . <&&&> sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? <&&&> not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . <&&&> that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . <&&&> Would you ? I wouldn't . <&&&> What would you do ? <&&&> Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . <&&&> One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . <&&&> Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? <&&&> As I said , I'd go round the world . <&&&> What would you do after that ? <&&&> Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . <&&&> It doesn't sound very exciting . Merry Christmas ! <&&&> The same to you ! How may I help you ? <&&&> I couldn ’ t find the book I was looking for . <&&&> Have you checked the database ? <&&&> I checked . <&&&> Was it on the shelf ? <&&&> It should have been , but it wasn ’ t . <&&&> Maybe someone took it . <&&&> Will you be getting another copy anytime soon ? <&&&> I ’ m sure we will . <&&&> Would you be able to reserve it for me ? <&&&> I sure will . Hey Jack . How's it going ? <&&&> I'm falling in love . <&&&> What ! With who ? <&&&> That girl in my econ class . She is so hot . <&&&> Did you guys go on a date already ? <&&&> No . I didn't even talk to her yet . But I think I'm in love . <&&&> Does she have a boyfriend ? <&&&> I don't think so . I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy . <&&&> Dude , you're a stalker man . Just ask her on a date . What's that ? <&&&> It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? What are you going to have for breakfast ? <&&&> I just have some cereal each morning . <&&&> You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast . <&&&> I don't always have time to make breakfast . <&&&> It's easy to make a quick breakfast . <&&&> What do you have for breakfast ? <&&&> When I need to make a quick breakfast , I just make some oatmeal , toast , and OJ . <&&&> That's a good idea . <&&&> It's not time consuming at all . <&&&> It doesn't take much time to make ? <&&&> Would you like me to make something ? I have been having a lot of headaches lately . <&&&> Have you been having these headaches for a long time ? <&&&> I have had headaches my whole life , but they have been getting worse lately . <&&&> Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . <&&&> That's serious . <&&&> I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . <&&&> So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . <&&&> Yes , it's an amazing drop . <&&&> Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . <&&&> Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? <&&&> Yes , and you know what ? Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . <&&&> Congratulations . That's great ! <&&&> I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . <&&&> When do you start ? <&&&> I start next Monday . <&&&> You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . <&&&> I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . <&&&> I bet . You must be stoked . <&&&> Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? <&&&> Sure . It's on you right ? <&&&> Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? <&&&> I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now . <&&&> I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help . Hi charles , I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian . <&&&> You did ? that is great ! <&&&> Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? <&&&> No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ? <&&&> Around seven . <&&&> Ok , great , should I bring anything ? <&&&> No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? <&&&> sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? <&&&> Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty . Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do . I don't know what to do , if I can't find the money . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Hello , there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund . <&&&> I see . The Fund Trading System of our Net Banking deals with both trading and information . If you use this system , you can subscribe for and apply to buy other funds . You can also get lots of other useful information . Have you got anything to declare , madam ? <&&&> No , I haven't . What a busy week ! <&&&> Really ! I've never seen so much work . <&&&> Right.How are you going to spend your weekend ? <&&&> I don't know . I have no idea . <&&&> Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ? <&&&> I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible . <&&&> You should try it.It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too.What do you say ? <&&&> OK , but don't say I didn't warn you . <&&&> That was a pretty good shot , Mary . Hello . I would like to buy some business cards . <&&&> Excellent . How many would you like ? <&&&> Two thousand would be fine . <&&&> You need to fill out this form , please . <&&&> All I want is the same thing on this card . The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . <&&&> They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today . <&&&> So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? <&&&> Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . <&&&> Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? <&&&> Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . <&&&> ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? <&&&> Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . <&&&> Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? Look ! There are playing The Matrix today . <&&&> You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? <&&&> I don't know . If we can't , we can buy from ticket scalpers . <&&&> No way . I'd rather go to another movie house . <&&&> Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture . <&&&> All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ? <&&&> Seven thirty . There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line ! <&&&> Shall we take a chance ? <&&&> Yeah , let's do so . Mary , how was your date with John ? <&&&> It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common . <&&&> Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? <&&&> He is tall and slim , fair-haired . Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? <&&&> Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? <&&&> No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . <&&&> Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . <&&&> What's the temperature today anyway ? Hey Jack . How's it going ? What a nice day ! <&&&> Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? <&&&> It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? <&&&> Sure . What's your room number , sir ? <&&&> It's 876 . Here is my key card . <&&&> A minute , please . It's 6215 yuan all together , tax included . <&&&> Can I pay with traveler's check ? <&&&> Sure . Can I have your passport , please ? Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? <&&&> I don ’ t see any problem ; only the car is a bit old . Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? <&&&> What ’ s it for ? I ’ d love to have my own farm . Hi , where have you been ? <&&&> I was away for my vacation . <&&&> Oh , how was it ? Can I help you ? I'd like to book a ticket to Shanghai . <&&&> When would you like to fly ? <&&&> As soon as possible . Do you have a flight tomorrow ? <&&&> I will check , please hold on . Sorry to say that flight is all booked up . Can I book you for the 3rd of September ? <&&&> That will be OK . <&&&> How many people are there in your party ? <&&&> Just me this time . <&&&> What class will you fly ? First class ? Business class ? Or economy class ? Did you move into your new apartment ? <&&&> Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . <&&&> Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . <&&&> Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . <&&&> Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? <&&&> Unfortunately , yes . <&&&> What do you mean by that ? <&&&> I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . <&&&> Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . <&&&> I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . <&&&> Is there a supermarket nearby ? <&&&> Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . <&&&> Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . Hello , police office ? <&&&> Yes , May I help you ? Do you have a free moment ? <&&&> Sure . What do you need ? <&&&> I ’ m having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? <&&&> Well , first you have to turn this switch on . <&&&> Silly me . <&&&> Now press this button . So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? <&&&> Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . <&&&> That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? <&&&> I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? <&&&> I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . <&&&> You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? <&&&> Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . <&&&> Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . <&&&> My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . Has the game started yet ? <&&&> Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? <&&&> Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . <&&&> That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? <&&&> I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . <&&&> Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . <&&&> That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . <&&&> Oh , God , I've forgotten it . <&&&> You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . <&&&> Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . <&&&> They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . hi , betty ! <&&&> hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? <&&&> pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . Mr . Smith . could you give me your quotation for your bicycle A5 , FOB Qingdao ? <&&&> Can You tell me how many you want to buy ? <&&&> 100 for immediate delivery , and 500 in two months time.that ' s by the end of July <&&&> Well . then , 260 yuan each . <&&&> Since this is a sizeable order , I was thinking you might give us a 5 % discount . hi , Natasha , how's life ? <&&&> great . My family came to visit me . <&&&> oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? <&&&> my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . Hello , this is Francis . Taxi . <&&&> Yes , sir , where are you going ? <&&&> I am going to the railway station . <&&&> Get on , please . <&&&> Thank you . Can we get there in half an hour ? We have the orientation this afternoon . <&&&> What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? <&&&> The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . <&&&> Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? Could I speak to Mary , please ? <&&&> This is Mary speaking . Who is that ? <&&&> This is Bob . Where have you been , Mary ? I have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour . Don ’ t you leave your home at 7 <&&&> Yes , I do , but today I went shopping and have only just come back . It is very nice to hear your voice , Bob . I didn ’ t know you were in New York . <&&&> I arrived this morning . I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . It has only just ended . Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? <&&&> Yes , I am going to meet a client . <&&&> But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! <&&&> I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . <&&&> I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . <&&&> I thought Henry usually did the conferences . <&&&> Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ? <&&&> I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late . <&&&> No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ? I want to send some money to Nanchang . Is it handled here ? <&&&> Yes , sir . How much would you like to remit ? <&&&> I want to remit 1,200 yuan to my brother in Nanchang . <&&&> No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ? <&&&> What's the difference ? Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ? <&&&> Yes , I have found three companies . <&&&> Have you called to inquire about the positions ? <&&&> Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . Are you interested in going sightseeing , Mr . Simpson ? I think you are here not only for the negotiation but also for sightseeing . <&&&> I heard that there are some beauty spots and places of historical interest in this city . <&&&> Shall we go to the Tiananmen Square first ? <&&&> That's great . I trouble you so much . Thank you very much . <&&&> It's my pleasure . Shall we go there on foot ? It's very near . We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . <&&&> I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . <&&&> You have some doubts about our products , I understand . <&&&> I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . <&&&> Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . <&&&> Yes , of course . <&&&> Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . <&&&> And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . <&&&> That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . <&&&> So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . <&&&> Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . <&&&> I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? <&&&> Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . <&&&> I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . <&&&> I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . Can I help you ? <&&&> I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . <&&&> I'll certainly try to help you.What topic is your paper on ? <&&&> My paper is on the influence of television on children . What courses are you taking ? Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? <&&&> Yes , but have you made an appointment ahead ? Could I speak to Mary , please ? <&&&> This is Mary speaking . Who is that ? <&&&> This is Bob . Where have you been , Mary ? I have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour . Don ’ t you leave your home at 7 <&&&> Yes , I do , but today I went shopping and have only just come back . It is very nice to hear your voice , Bob . I didn ’ t know you were in New York . <&&&> I arrived this morning . I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . It has only just ended . Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? <&&&> Yes , I am going to meet a client . Good morning . How can I help you ? <&&&> I want to apply for a passport here . I am really thirsty . <&&&> How about we go and get something to drink ? <&&&> Let's do that . <&&&> Do you know what you want to get ? <&&&> A soda sounds good . <&&&> Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty . Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week . <&&&> Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too . <&&&> How can we get there ? <&&&> We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station . <&&&> OK ! Let's go . You stay beside me ; I'll fry the meat in the oil first . There's a car waiting for you just outside the door . Right this way , please . They are playing the wedding march , and I have felt tears . <&&&> I'm very touched , and I can't help bursting into tears at the wedding . <&&&> Really ? I have seen that our wedding , but just mary's . <&&&> Mary looks so beautiful in the wedding gown , and I record the moment that I was bride . <&&&> You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ? <&&&> Judy , Why are you so interested in her ? <&&&> Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman Hello ? Is that Mark ? <&&&> How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages . <&&&> I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ? <&&&> Pretty busy.So are you back for good ? <&&&> Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing . <&&&> Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . Can you send someone to fix my internet ? <&&&> Are you having a problem with it ? <&&&> My internet is having problems connecting . Excuse me , would you like a drink before your meal ? <&&&> Pardon me ? <&&&> Would you like a drink ? May I help you ? <&&&> I can ’ t find the book I want . How old are you ? <&&&> Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? <&&&> I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . <&&&> Are you going to have a birthday party ? Do you want to practice your driving right now ? <&&&> No problem . We can do it right now . <&&&> Are you buckled up ? <&&&> All right . Now what do I do ? <&&&> Start the car . <&&&> Which way do you want me to go ? <&&&> Take a left . <&&&> How far do you want me to go ? <&&&> I'll tell you when to stop . <&&&> Just make sure to tell me beforehand . Good morning , sir.Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to see the manager.Here ' s my card . <&&&> Thank you , Mr.Wang.Do you have an appointment ? <&&&> No , I'm afraid I don't . Is it possible for me to see him now ? <&&&> I'm afraid Mr.Li is engaged at the moment . Would you mind waiting ? Thank you for coming to see me off . <&&&> Not at all . <&&&> If I have time , I will come again . <&&&> You are welcome at any time . Do you take a bus to and from work ? <&&&> Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction . <&&&> Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded . <&&&> Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . <&&&> That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . <&&&> What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? <&&&> You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! <&&&> Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . <&&&> Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? <&&&> He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . <&&&> Where will it be ? <&&&> We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . Is there anything I can do for you ? <&&&> I want a chemise . <&&&> You have really good taste . It's the best seller right now . Can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like two kilos of eggs . <&&&> What kind ? Is that the Japanese Restaurant ? can I see your passport , please ? <&&&> is this line for non-residents ? <&&&> yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right . <&&&> Ok . Here's my passport . <&&&> what's the expiration date on your passport ? Excuse me , is this the way to the Great Wall ? <&&&> Oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . Good morning . How can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to open a new account . <&&&> Have you filled out an application form ? <&&&> Yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? <&&&> Yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? <&&&> Yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? <&&&> Yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . <&&&> That's very convenient . <&&&> It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? <&&&> Yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? <&&&> The maximum is $ 1000 . <&&&> Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? <&&&> sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? <&&&> I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . <&&&> that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? <&&&> I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . <&&&> if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? <&&&> I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . <&&&> you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . <&&&> the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . <&&&> the Taj it is then . <&&&> shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? <&&&> they'll still charge us a corkage fee . <&&&> that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . <&&&> don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . <&&&> are you sure ? We could go Dutch . Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . <&&&> You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . <&&&> Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? <&&&> The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . <&&&> Wow ! What a hit ! <&&&> Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . <&&&> Is he ok ? <&&&> It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . <&&&> I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . <&&&> The Giants ? <&&&> Yeah . <&&&> Well , here we go again . Who is the next ? <&&&> I am . <&&&> All right . Over here , sir . How are you today ? <&&&> Fine , thanks . <&&&> How do you want you hair cut ? <&&&> Don't make it too short . I just want a trim . <&&&> Yes , sir . I will use the scissors.Do you always part your hair on the left ? <&&&> Yes , I do.That looks good . It's not too short.It ' s just right . How much do I owe you ? Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? <&&&> Yes , I am . You must be Tom . Nice to meet you . <&&&> Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags . <&&&> Be careful , Tom . Those are pretty heavy . Hello ! Is Mr . Green there ? <&&&> Speaking . May I ask whom I am talking to ? <&&&> This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition . <&&&> Oh , yes . I remember your company . <&&&> Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? <&&&> I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . Good afternoon , would you mind if I sat here ? <&&&> Of course not . <&&&> I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ? <&&&> Laura . <&&&> Do you like this place ? <&&&> I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . <&&&> How often ? <&&&> Well , we come here almost every month . I was thinking about applying for the new position . <&&&> Do you think that is a good idea ? <&&&> It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . <&&&> What are your main concerns ? <&&&> Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . <&&&> I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . Do you like traveling , Kathy ? Is Tom in ? <&&&> Wrong number . Are you busy with your work ? <&&&> Yes . What about you ? <&&&> Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime . Happy New Year , Rose . <&&&> Happy New Year , Thomas . How many joys nice drinks with us , will you ? <&&&> Thank you , I will . What are you up to today ? Hello , Mr.Benson , welcome to Beijing ! Is this your first time to visit china ? <&&&> Oh , no , I'v already made several trips to Guangzhou , this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be . <&&&> Yes , Beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ? <&&&> I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here , I always want to go there , I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall , do you think I have a chance to see it ? <&&&> I can pretty sure it can be arranged , the wall is a short distance from the city , but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks , I also recommend you to visit Tian'an Men Square and city while you add it ! Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? <&&&> You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . <&&&> What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . <&&&> Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? <&&&> I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . <&&&> I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . <&&&> That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . <&&&> Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . I think I've looked everywhere , but I haven't seen a swimming pool here . <&&&> This hotel has no full-size pool , but we do have swim stations in our gym . <&&&> Swim stations ? Whoever heard of such a thing ? <&&&> You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill . <&&&> All that exercise in a little pool ! Do I have to pay anything ? What may I do for you ? I really think all Americans look alike . <&&&> You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough . <&&&> But they do . Excuse me , sir . What would you like to eat , Chinese food or western food ? <&&&> I'd like to have Chinese food . <&&&> Are you going to have this set course or have dinner in the dining room ? <&&&> Right here , please . <&&&> Please put down the table in front of you . It's more comfortable that way . <&&&> Oh , thank you . So nice you are . <&&&> It's my pleasure . What would you like to drink , milk , tea , coffee , orange juice or iced water ? <&&&> I want a cup of bean milk . Do you have any ? We hope that partial shipment is allowed . <&&&> Could you explain in detail ? <&&&> Shipping the goods is to be made in three equal monthly installments . Good morning . How are you ? <&&&> I'm very worried , doctor <&&&> Oh ? What are you worried about ? <&&&> I'm afraid that I'm very ill . <&&&> I'm sorry to hear that . Why do you think so ? <&&&> Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little . <&&&> How do you sleep ? <&&&> Very badly , doctor . <&&&> Do you find it difficult to get to sleep , or do you wake up early ? Who are we going to play with today ? <&&&> We are playing against Hainan . <&&&> Oh , the basketball team from No . 1 College ? I know they're a tough team . Hey , daughter . Let me ask you something . <&&&> Yes , Dad ? <&&&> Do you have life insurance ? Ah , ah , ah ... <&&&> All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast . <&&&> Jog ? <&&&> Then , you are to walk to work . <&&&> Walk ? <&&&> Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time . What's happening , officer ? <&&&> There is a fire in your building . You need to evacuate immediately . <&&&> What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! <&&&> Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely . I received an E-mail from mother today . Do you have spare time tonight ? <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> There will be a live show of football tonight . <&&&> What teams are playing tonight ? <&&&> AC Milan versus Real Madrid . <&&&> That will be a tough match , right ? You'll have to take a make-up exam in logic . <&&&> Oh , I thought I did a good job . <&&&> Sorry to say you failed . so , tell me about your new house . How is it different to your old one ? <&&&> well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! <&&&> so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? <&&&> yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on <&&&> what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . <&&&> that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . <&&&> are the rooms nice and bright ? <&&&> yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . <&&&> do you have a balcony ? <&&&> no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . <&&&> you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? Good morning , Mr . Smith . Would you like to see around the factory ? Did you get your grades yet ? <&&&> Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . <&&&> Why ? What happened ? <&&&> Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . <&&&> Ouch . You must be very disappointed . <&&&> Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . <&&&> Why don't you re-take the class next year ? <&&&> That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? <&&&> I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . <&&&> My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . <&&&> What was your GPA before this semester ? <&&&> I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . <&&&> Why did it go down so much ? <&&&> Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . Excuse me . But are you Mrs . Smith from America ? Did you need help ? <&&&> Where do I go to pick up my ballot ? <&&&> I ’ ll help you with that . <&&&> How ’ s that ? Hi , Ben . Here are the top ten of this week's top chart . <&&&> Oh , great ! <&&&> Which is your favorite in this ten ? <&&&> I like No . 4 . <&&&> You mean Sweet Heart . <&&&> Yes . In fact , I think it's much better than this week's No . 1 . <&&&> What do you think about Cold Wind ? <&&&> I like it as well , but I don't think it's as good as Sweet Heart . <&&&> So No . 4 is your favorite . Which one don't you like ? What is your great struck ? <&&&> I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . <&&&> Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ? <&&&> Because I ’ m very competent in this area . <&&&> Are you working under pressure ? <&&&> Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . <&&&> Are you more a follower or a leader ? Where did you go yesterday ? Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? <&&&> Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . <&&&> I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . <&&&> Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . May I help you ? Miss ! <&&&> Yes . I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow . <&&&> What color set do you prefer ? <&&&> Well , brown . <&&&> We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . Look at the colors . Aren't they beautiful ? <&&&> But they're purple . I prefer a brown set . <&&&> If you insist , I can show you the brown sets . I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though . <&&&> Well , I'm not so sure . Most of my make-up is brown . <&&&> Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it . <&&&> Can I try it ? <&&&> Sure . Are you wearing any make-up ? You are from Japan , aren't you ? <&&&> Oh , yes ! <&&&> I love Japan a lot . <&&&> I am glad to hear that . <&&&> Let's go to another place where my friend is working , let me pay here . Have you ever been to Britain ? <&&&> Oh yes , I ’ Ve been to Britain many times . I go there on business . Hello , this is Rich . <&&&> Hi , Rich . Is Jim here ? <&&&> He ’ s not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? <&&&> Sure . This is Claire . <&&&> Does have your telephone number ? <&&&> No , it ’ s 3725019281 . <&&&> 3725015281 ? <&&&> No , it ’ s 3725019281 , it ’ s a 9 , not a 5 . <&&&> Right . I ’ ll have him call you back . <&&&> Can you tell him that it ’ s urgent ? Excuse me , do you have A tale of Two Cities ? I'd like a copy of it . Can you get me a taxi ? <&&&> We offer various types of transportation . Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle ? <&&&> Thanks , but no thanks . A taxi will do just fine . <&&&> In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style . <&&&> No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers . <&&&> Got it , sir . Where would you like the taxi to take you ? <&&&> My destination is Rockefeller Center . <&&&> What time do you want to leave the hotel ? I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday . <&&&> I wanted to go , but I couldn't . <&&&> It was a great game . <&&&> It's too bad that I couldn't make it . Who won ? <&&&> Our team played hard and won . <&&&> I really wish I went to the game . <&&&> It was the best game ever . <&&&> So tell me the final score . <&&&> The other team lost by three points , 101-98 . Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ? <&&&> I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday . <&&&> You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest . <&&&> I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ? why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? <&&&> well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . <&&&> what are they ? <&&&> one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . <&&&> why ? <&&&> the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . <&&&> that makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . <&&&> and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . <&&&> what's that ? <&&&> nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! <&&&> wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . <&&&> yeah , I guess so . Aren't you staying for the party ? <&&&> No . I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow . Are you a newcomer ? <&&&> Yeah , this is my first visit here . <&&&> You speak good English , though . <&&&> Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? <&&&> Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . <&&&> You are kidding , but she's so helpful . <&&&> Tom ... you are her boss , you kown.Of course , she's helpful to you . <&&&> Come on . She's like that with everyone . I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! <&&&> Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma . <&&&> Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! <&&&> Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! <&&&> No , fireworks are awesome ! <&&&> Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? <&&&> I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all . <&&&> Ahahah ... really ? <&&&> Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? Anything else I can do for you ? <&&&> I need ten 55 cents stamps and ten 32 cents stamps , please . <&&&> OK , here you are.Anything else ? <&&&> Yes , I need to send the payment to immigration for my aunt's citizenship application . They won't accept checks.How do I send the money ? <&&&> You can buy a money order and mail mature immigration . <&&&> Then I need a money order for 250 dollars . Excuse me , is this the way to the Great Wall ? <&&&> Oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . <&&&> I must have taken a wrong turn . <&&&> It doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . <&&&> And then ? who are you writing a letter to ? <&&&> I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? <&&&> OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . <&&&> that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? <&&&> well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . <&&&> you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? <&&&> just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . <&&&> congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! <&&&> shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? <&&&> ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! <&&&> it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . <&&&> ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . <&&&> I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . <&&&> that's thoughtful of you . <&&&> and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . Hi , there ’ s a problem with this stereo . I ’ d like to return it , please . <&&&> What ’ s the problem ? <&&&> The tape player doesn ’ t work . <&&&> O . K . Do you have your receipt ? <&&&> Yes , here you are . <&&&> Thank you . Do you want your money back , or would you like to exchange it ? <&&&> I think I ’ d like to just get another stereo , please . How many people are there in your family ? <&&&> There are 15 people in my family . <&&&> What did you say ? How many ? <&&&> 15 people . <&&&> Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ? <&&&> Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me . <&&&> But you don't live at home anymore . that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up . <&&&> it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . <&&&> I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? <&&&> I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . <&&&> I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . <&&&> afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . <&&&> yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . <&&&> Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . <&&&> I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . <&&&> I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . <&&&> Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card . <&&&> Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . <&&&> I'm finished . <&&&> I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form , please . <&&&> OK , the form is all filled out . <&&&> Perfect !

How are you getting along with your paper ? <&&&> I haven't finished it . It is very difficult . I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! <&&&> Oh , my dear lady.Take it easy.You should forgive a green hand like him . <&&&> He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . <&&&> I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . <&&&> I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . <&&&> Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss . <&&&> Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . What are the requirements to apply for the position ? <&&&> Your major must be computer . <&&&> Do you think my educational background suits this position ? <&&&> Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . <&&&> Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? <&&&> Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . <&&&> Could you tell something about the job ? Excuse me . Are you Mr . Smith ? <&&&> No , I'm not .

I just followed the instructions ! <&&&> I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! <&&&> hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . <&&&> it's a deal . <&&&> do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? <&&&> yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? <&&&> I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! <&&&> I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . <&&&> if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . Here you are . How is Danny ? <&&&> Better now . We are just back from the hospital . We were lucky to meet a well-known doctor . <&&&> What did the doctor say ? <&&&> He said that he had a really bad cold . <&&&> Shall we go back home now ? <&&&> The dispensary closed .

I do a lot of things , such as typing , handling the daily correspondence , arranging meetings and so on . <&&&> Do you enjoy your work ? Where is some fresh produce that's on sale ? <&&&> Well , I think you'll like the mangoes . <&&&> I've never had a mango . <&&&> It's a fruit . It has a big stone in it . <&&&> Can you eat the stone ? <&&&> No . You would break all your teeth on it . <&&&> How much are these mangoes ? <&&&> The sale price today is $ 1 each . Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? <&&&> I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ?

Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! <&&&> What is it ? What happened ? <&&&> I think someone is stalking me . <&&&> No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? <&&&> I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe .

All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms . <&&&> I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ? <&&&> We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for . <&&&> It's not that serious . <&&&> Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ? Hi ! Susan ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages ! <&&&> I ’ Ve been really busy . How is everything ?

I need to start the procedure to evict you . <&&&> Are you taking my apartment away ? <&&&> This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent .

Something around two hundred , I guess . <&&&> Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . <&&&> Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? <&&&> Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . <&&&> How much did she ask for ?

She looks great . <&&&> Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . <&&&> Really ? Tell me more . <&&&> Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . <&&&> Wow , crikey . So what happened ? <&&&> Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . <&&&> Wow . <&&&> Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? <&&&> I have no idea what you're talking about . <&&&> Oh , come on . Everybody knows . <&&&> Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? <&&&> Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . <&&&> That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? <&&&> I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . <&&&> Why ?

I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days . <&&&> What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? <&&&> That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . <&&&> Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? <&&&> Yes , that is why I never drink it . <&&&> Do you drink green tea , then ? <&&&> Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . <&&&> But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . <&&&> What good is it for ?

How much is it ? <&&&> 250 Yuan . <&&&> Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it . <&&&> But it is really worthwhile . Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . <&&&> Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? <&&&> I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . <&&&> I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . <&&&> I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . <&&&> Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . <&&&> In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? <&&&> It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . <&&&> Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? <&&&> If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . <&&&> It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . <&&&> We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . <&&&> Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky.Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ah . <&&&> Ahhhhhhhh <&&&> Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? <&&&> A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . <&&&> Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch o <&&&> Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? <&&&> Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so yo Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? <&&&> How regular ? <&&&> An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . <&&&> You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . Excuse me , are there any more shopping carts ? <&&&> Yes , you can find it at the entrance . <&&&> But there isn't a single one right now . <&&&> Ok , I'll get one for you . <&&&> thank you , I'll wait here . <&&&> Here it is . It ’ s really hard to find a shopping cart at this moment . <&&&> Thanks a lot . By the way , do you make the deliveries ? Hello , BCD Company , can I help you ? <&&&> Hello , may I speak to Mrs Smith ? <&&&> This is Mrs Smith , may I have your name ? <&&&> This is Sun , and I interviewed with you yesterday . <&&&> Hello , Mr . Sun . <&&&> I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday . <&&&> You are welcome , Mr . Sun . Yes , I think there is something wrong with my car . <&&&> What's the matter ? <&&&> When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is . <&&&> Let me see . Are you still at that work ? <&&&> Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job . <&&&> What sort of job do you have in mind ? <&&&> I think I'm quite fit for a driver . What are you doing now , Steven ? <&&&> I am reading a book about money management . <&&&> Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money . <&&&> Everyone wants to earn a lot of money . Don't you think so ? What's more , I am interested in money management . <&&&> No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . <&&&> Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money . Do you have any other questions ? <&&&> Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ? <&&&> According to our regulations , you will be on probation for the first three months . How's your business ? <&&&> Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it . <&&&> Things are tough all over . You should never give up ! <&&&> But how can I prevent a deficit ? <&&&> I think you should make a thorough market investigation now . <&&&> OK , OK . I ’ ll do my best . <&&&> I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up . The NASDAQ gained a few points today . <&&&> Does it mean anything ? <&&&> It's hard to say . The stock market is weird . You never know what will happen tomorrow . <&&&> Why do you buy stocks , then ? What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? <&&&> I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? <&&&> I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . <&&&> I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . <&&&> Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! <&&&> Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . <&&&> In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . <&&&> That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? did you get my email ? <&&&> I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? <&&&> sure . <&&&> how did the business trip go ? <&&&> well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . <&&&> I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! <&&&> I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! <&&&> our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . <&&&> I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . <&&&> I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . <&&&> thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! What is a visa used for ? <&&&> It is a significant document for traveling abroad and visiting . <&&&> Oh . Where do I need to apply for a visa ? <&&&> There are passport processing center in many places . Visa is dealt with in embassies . You need to complete several forms and provide certain certificate . Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? <&&&> It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . <&&&> It seems that the climate in this country is changing . <&&&> The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . <&&&> I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . <&&&> I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . George , is your chicken OK ? <&&&> It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ? <&&&> My fish is very dry . <&&&> I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it . I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . <&&&> Well , we just got in some mangoes . <&&&> Mangoes . What are they ? <&&&> Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . <&&&> Can you eat the nut ? <&&&> No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . <&&&> How much are they ? <&&&> Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . <&&&> What does a mango taste like ? <&&&> They're like a citrus fruit . <&&&> How do I know if it's ripe ? Be quick . Put our bags in the deposit box . What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? <&&&> I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? <&&&> About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . <&&&> I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . <&&&> Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . <&&&> Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . <&&&> How ’ s your son these days ? <&&&> Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . <&&&> He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? <&&&> I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . <&&&> Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am . I'd like to check in , PLS . <&&&> Awfully sorry , sir . There are no rooms available now . <&&&> But I ’ Ve reserved a room the day before yesterday . <&&&> Sorry , may I have your name ? <&&&> Tony Bush . <&&&> Pls wait a minute , let me check . Excuse me , but I can't seem to find your name on our list . Are you sure you have a reservation for tonight ? <&&&> Of course , I did it myself . <&&&> I am terribly sorry . There must have been some mistakes . Let me check it again . Oh , yes , there is a name listed as Tommy Bush . It must be the fault of the clerk who registered your name . I apologize . <&&&> Don't worry about that . Taxi ! Taxi ! <&&&> Where to , sir ? <&&&> I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . <&&&> Please hop in . <&&&> Is it a long run to the station ? <&&&> It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . <&&&> The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? <&&&> Yes , they are . <&&&> Is it the rush hour now ? <&&&> Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry sir ? <&&&> No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? I ’ ll take this blouse and skirt please . I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . Where to , miss ? <&&&> Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . <&&&> Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? <&&&> From China . <&&&> Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . <&&&> It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . What did you do over the weekend ? <&&&> I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . <&&&> Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? <&&&> It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . <&&&> Like what ? <&&&> Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . <&&&> What else can we do to protect the environment ? Good morning , I want a room tonight . <&&&> Single or double ? <&&&> Single , please . <&&&> Do you have a reservation ? <&&&> Yes . I made a reservation in shanghai . <&&&> Then I believe you have a confirmation slip . <&&&> Yeah . Let me see . Is this the one you want ? <&&&> That ’ s it . What ’ s your name . please ? <&&&> Wu Mei . That ’ s my name . <&&&> Just a moment , please . Yes , you have a room reservation for you . <&&&> Is this room with a bath room ? <&&&> Yes , it ’ s . <&&&> Can you give me a quiet room ? <&&&> It ’ s a inside room on the eight floor . I was inquiring about a bill that I never got . <&&&> Which credit card was the bill for ? <&&&> The bill was for my Master Card . <&&&> That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago . <&&&> It never came in the mail . Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? <&&&> The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! <&&&> I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? <&&&> I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . <&&&> Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . <&&&> I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . <&&&> That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . Well , what is your trouble ? Hello , I need to come in and see the doctor . <&&&> Are you scheduling a check-up , or are you ill ? <&&&> I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at . <&&&> Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash ? <&&&> No , but I have a low fever . <&&&> I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday . Which one would work best for you ? <&&&> I want to come in on Wednesday . Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? <&&&> Don't you know that ? It's all about new office rules . <&&&> What does it say ? <&&&> It says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . It might be the most terrible thing for you . <&&&> I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? <&&&> If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department . <&&&> But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? <&&&> The note says you should call your manager first , and then tell him your reason , and then ask him for the approval .

Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . <&&&> Is your helmet comfortable ? <&&&> Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . <&&&> Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . <&&&> I'll think about it . <&&&> Is that your new bicycle ? <&&&> Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday .

If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ’ s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so . Good morning , Mr Wang . <&&&> Good morning . What time is it now ? <&&&> It's just nine o'clock . <&&&> I'm on time today <&&&> Yes , you're on time . Are you often late ? Hello . Is this Ann ? <&&&> Yes , it is . Kelly ? <&&&> Yes , it's me . <&&&> Do you have a cold ? <&&&> No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . <&&&> Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? <&&&> I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . <&&&> I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? <&&&> Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . <&&&> Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? <&&&> Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . <&&&> Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? <&&&> I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . <&&&> It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . <&&&> Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . We have a holiday next week , don't we ? <&&&> Yes , on Monday . <&&&> What're you going to do ? <&&&> I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> I'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago . <&&&> OK , take a seat please , sir . First of all , can you show me your ID please ? <&&&> Sure . Here you are . <&&&> OK , could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ? <&&&> Of course , it's a soft leather one , you know , not a sports one that looks childish . <&&&> Mmm ... does it zip closed ? <&&&> No , it's straps closed , and it has a buckle in the front . <&&&> OK , can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ? <&&&> Oh , yeah , the brand name . <&&&> So what's it , sir ? <&&&> Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . <&&&> OK , can you name the items in it ? <&&&> Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife . I'm sorry , I've lost my tags and receipt . What can I do about it ? <&&&> I see . What is your baggage ? And do you remember the tag's number or color ? <&&&> It's a suitcase . Its colour is blue . <&&&> Could you give me a description of your case ? <&&&> It's like this , it's square with a leather cover . Where ’ s the wagon ? Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . <&&&> Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? <&&&> I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . <&&&> I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . <&&&> I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . <&&&> Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . <&&&> In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? <&&&> It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . <&&&> Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? <&&&> If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . <&&&> It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . <&&&> We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . <&&&> If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . Where are you from ? <&&&> I'm from Germany . Mary , I will have an interview tomorrow . I am so excited ! Bob , you look pale . What happened ? <&&&> I didn't sleep a wink last night . <&&&> Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you . <&&&> Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . <&&&> Is there anything I can do for you ? Are there any special unemployment forms I need to fill out ? <&&&> You need to get a special application form . <&&&> Do you know where I can find the application form ? <&&&> You can go to the Employment Development Office and pick it up . <&&&> What records will I have to show to apply for unemployment benefits ? <&&&> They will need a record showing who you worked for and when you worked for them . <&&&> Is there anything else I will need to provide ? <&&&> Be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof . <&&&> Do I need to do anything else after I turn in the application ? Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ? It's not good for business recently . <&&&> Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . Let's go to the cinema by bus . <&&&> Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient . <&&&> OK , it will be a new experience for me . What can I do for you today ? <&&&> I need to buy a new refrigerator today . Is my hair done yet ? <&&&> Yeah , I just need to make the final touches . <&&&> How long until you're finished ? <&&&> I'm finished . What do you think ? <&&&> I like my hair so much . I've got a telegraphic order . Will you cash it ? <&&&> Have you got any identification ( ID ) with you ? Did you even bother to go to school today ? <&&&> Yeah , I went . Did you go ? <&&&> No , I didn't feel like it . <&&&> That's nice , have you been to the movies lately ? <&&&> No , but that was a random change of subject . <&&&> It may have been random , but have you ? <&&&> I haven't lately . <&&&> I would love to catch a movie this weekend . <&&&> So then , why don't you just go ? what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! <&&&> that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . Ah ! No ! Damn it ! <&&&> It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . <&&&> So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . <&&&> Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? <&&&> No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . <&&&> I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . <&&&> I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . <&&&> What are we going to do now ? <&&&> I don't know . I feel like going out . <&&&> I wonder how much of the city is down . Tell me something about yourself and your past experience . <&&&> I have eight years of experience working in the IT industry . For the past two years , I have been working as a project manager for a dotcom . I am also MI certified . I'm looking for a team environment where I can join the excitement of building a company . <&&&> What experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ? <&&&> No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign . <&&&> You were born in the year of the monkey ? I need a room for a few days . <&&&> That won't be a problem . Could you please tell me your name ? <&&&> John Sandals . That's S A N D A L S . <&&&> Sir , I'm Michelle , and I run the front desk . Please tell me the days you'll be here . <&&&> I'll be there in April Friday through Monday , the 14th through the 17th . <&&&> We recently changed many things here , sir , including our prices . Do you mind , sir ? <&&&> Possibly . What's the actual price ? <&&&> The price will be $ 308 a night . <&&&> $ 308 ! That's not bad . <&&&> Very good . Now , Mr . Sandals , about the room , smoking or nonsmoking ? <&&&> Nonsmoking , definitely ! <&&&> Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking . Now , does a queen sound okay ? <&&&> Yes , that'll be just fine . <&&&> One more second , sir . Your reservation is now verified , so all I need is your phone number . <&&&> It's 626-555-1739 . What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? <&&&> We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . <&&&> How hard is the climb ? <&&&> It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . <&&&> What did you do last week ? <&&&> We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ? <&&&> Yes . Do you want to go with me ? <&&&> OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium . <&&&> Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ? <&&&> Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart . <&&&> That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . <&&&> How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage . I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . <&&&> That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . Out of every movie that you've seen , which one is your favorite ? <&&&> I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever . <&&&> You think so , how come ? <&&&> Well , Superbad is super funny . I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . What is this eviction notice for ? <&&&> The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate . <&&&> Are you kidding me ? <&&&> I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business . <&&&> You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! <&&&> You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you . <&&&> Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ? <&&&> You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments . Good afternoon madam . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Hi . I want to check out . My room is 1005 . So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? <&&&> I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . <&&&> And how do you like working for IBM ? <&&&> It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . <&&&> What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? <&&&> I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny . <&&&> It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson . <&&&> And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ? Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . <&&&> I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . <&&&> She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . Good afternoon Miss.Are there plane tickets to San Francisco on the day after tomorrow ? <&&&> Good afternoon Sir . I'll have a look at the time-table for you . I'm sorry but there aren't any direct flights available . <&&&> Are there tickets for Saturday then ? <&&&> Yes there are.How do you want to go , First class or coach ? This apartment is great , but could I upgrade a few things ? <&&&> What are you unhappy with ? <&&&> I want to have a different color carpet . <&&&> If you agree to pay more money , you could upgrade the carpet . Carlo's Kitchen . Is there a bus in Altadena that'll take me to downtown LA ? <&&&> The 486 . <&&&> The 486 really goes downtown ? <&&&> Yes , it does . <&&&> How long is the bus ride ? <&&&> It's about forty-five minutes to an hour . <&&&> Is that right ? I'm calling about you appointment.Mr.Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to . <&&&> When can I go to see him ? <&&&> Anytime except today.Please give him a call before you come . Sandra is actually a blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . <&&&> That's fate . Why do you want to take the police to court ? What can I do for you ? <&&&> I would like to open another account . <&&&> What kind do you want to open ? <&&&> I want to open a savings account . <&&&> Do you have an account opened with this bank already ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> You can always transfer money from that account into your new one . <&&&> That would be great . David , would you like something to eat ? <&&&> No , I'm full . Where are you going ? <&&&> It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night . <&&&> I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it . <&&&> Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment . Good morning ! Marquette General Hospital . Tia speaking . May I help you ? <&&&> Hi , this is Emily Wang , I want to see a doctor today . <&&&> Your medical card No . , please ? Susan , we ’ re going to need those data before tomorrow . you're finally here ! What took so long ? <&&&> I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . <&&&> it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . <&&&> I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . <&&&> perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . <&&&> I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . <&&&> it would be better for the environment , too . <&&&> I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . <&&&> taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . <&&&> the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . <&&&> well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . <&&&> that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! Can I help you , Ma'am ? <&&&> I need a phone card for this new cell phone . <&&&> Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ? <&&&> It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student . <&&&> Then the M-Zone will be suitable . <&&&> What's special with the service ? <&&&> You know students use tested message service . And they provide favorable service for that . <&&&> That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card . <&&&> Oh , there is a sales promotion for it now . <&&&> Oh , good . Then what is it ? are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? <&&&> of course . Is the dinner still on ? <&&&> yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . <&&&> we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . <&&&> that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . <&&&> it can't be that bad . <&&&> I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . <&&&> really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . <&&&> do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . <&&&> ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? <&&&> when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . Hi ! How are things going with you ? <&&&> I am doing well . What ’ s up with you ? <&&&> Believe it or not , the company I worked for closed down , so I ’ m out of a job . <&&&> The same with me . Have you given much thought to what you want to do next ? <&&&> I am not being all that particular right now because I just need to keep a roof over my head . <&&&> How about interviews ? Have you been on any of those yet ? <&&&> I wish that I could get the opportunity to be interviewed . <&&&> How about the electrician program that they have listed over there ? We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . <&&&> I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . <&&&> You have some doubts about our products , I understand . <&&&> I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . <&&&> Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . <&&&> Yes , of course . <&&&> Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . <&&&> And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . <&&&> That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . <&&&> So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . <&&&> Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? <&&&> That depends . What does she look like ? <&&&> Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . <&&&> How tall is she ? <&&&> She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . <&&&> Is she chubby ? <&&&> Not at all . She's actually very athletic . <&&&> It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? <&&&> No , but she does wear contact lenses . <&&&> How's her skin ? <&&&> She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . <&&&> Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? <&&&> I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos <&&&> What's the tattoo on her foot like ? <&&&> It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one . I've come to apologize for what I said yesterday . <&&&> Don ’ t think any more about it . <&&&> I must make an apology for losing my temper . Hi , Jack ! How are you doing ? <&&&> Just so-so.You ' re doing all right ? Hello , is this housekeeper ? <&&&> Yes ma'am , may I help you ? <&&&> This is room eleven-seven and we have just checked in . May I take your order now ? <&&&> Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . <&&&> How would you like your eggs ? Mr Brown ! How nice to see you , can I help ? <&&&> I'm not exactly sure if it's your department , but I'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for Comprehensive Credit Granting . <&&&> I see . You are one of my favourite customers , Mr Brown . I'm more than happy to help . For Comprehensive Credit Granting , IBA will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . Of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch . <&&&> How long a period will you look at to determine this ? I don ’ t know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has louse up my business several times . <&&&> You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ? <&&&> Yeah . Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? <&&&> No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . Hello , Jack here . <&&&> Hello , Jack . It ’ s Mary . What are you doing in your office ? <&&&> I ’ m working . I often work late on Thursday . I ’ m busy this week . What do you think ? <&&&> It looks great . <&&&> I would like to purchase it . <&&&> Will this be cash or charge ? <&&&> Here , take my credit card . <&&&> Just sign here , please . <&&&> Sure . Here you go . Professor , can you help me add your class ? <&&&> You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ? <&&&> No , I will have to get an add sheet . <&&&> You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? <&&&> No , I don't know where that is . <&&&> The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be . <&&&> I think I can find it . <&&&> You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . <&&&> Thank you for letting me add your class . Mr . Wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ? <&&&> Of course , I ’ Ve enjoyed it very much . I ’ Ve met my old friends and made some new friends . <&&&> We ’ Ve all enjoyed being with you . When will you come back ? <&&&> Sometime next year . How can I help you today ? <&&&> I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? <&&&> Have you got some ID and your cash card ? <&&&> Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too . <&&&> How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ? <&&&> I'm not quite sure . You see , I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card , but I really don't know how much I should get . What is your long-term goal in this career ? <&&&> My long-term goal is to become an expert in this field . <&&&> What would you do to achieve that ? May I see your passport please ? <&&&> Yes . Here it is . <&&&> Are you travelling for business or pleasure ? <&&&> I'm going to visit some relatives here for several months . <&&&> Do you have anything to declare ? Jewellery or cash ? What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? <&&&> I'm planing to go bowling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . <&&&> Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? <&&&> He ’ s nearly 90 . <&&&> Good gracious ! Are you sure ? Whoa . Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer . <&&&> I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek . I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? <&&&> Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . <&&&> What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . <&&&> Didn't you get the memo ? <&&&> What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . <&&&> The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . <&&&> You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? <&&&> It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? <&&&> I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . See how many people are here ! What can I do for you ? <&&&> I wish to buy a diamond ring . <&&&> How many carats diamond do you want ? <&&&> Two carats . <&&&> Is this one suit for you ? <&&&> No , it seems too old-fashioned . <&&&> What about this ? <&&&> Let me try it on , it's too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? <&&&> Yes , try this one please . Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ? <&&&> No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance . <&&&> Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ? <&&&> Well , how old is your baby ? <&&&> No more than three . <&&&> The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand . <&&&> How about its quality ? So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? <&&&> Stolen ? No , why ? <&&&> My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . <&&&> Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless . <&&&> I don't know . The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good . <&&&> If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened . <&&&> He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . And on a crowded street too . Hello , John . How are you ? <&&&> I'm fine , thanks . And you ? I have a little problem with room 507 . <&&&> Problems are what we're here for , sir . Please tell me your problem . <&&&> This room is filthy with cockroaches . <&&&> Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them , sir ? <&&&> I've already seen nine of them and , as they say , eight is enough ! <&&&> Sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots . Excuse me , is there a table for 8 right now ? <&&&> Let me see ... I am sorry the tables you want are booked . <&&&> Well , since there are some small square tables , could we put two tables together ? You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? <&&&> In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . <&&&> Like what ? Come on in . Let me show you around . Here ’ s the living room . <&&&> Great . The view from this window is wonderful . <&&&> This is the kitchen . <&&&> It looks new . <&&&> Yes . We just renovated a few month ago . not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! <&&&> can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . <&&&> yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . <&&&> actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . <&&&> addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! <&&&> yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? <&&&> absolutely . <&&&> do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? <&&&> yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . Excuse me . I lost my way . Could you tell me where the scholar cinema is , please ? <&&&> The Scholar ? Let me see . Oh ... yes , Of course I know . It ’ s in the Lincoln Square . Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . <&&&> A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? <&&&> There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . <&&&> I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . <&&&> What about sunday ? <&&&> I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday . Hi , I ’ m the superintendent of this building . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Hi , I ’ m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ? <&&&> Sure . Let ’ s go . <&&&> I like this one . How much is the rent ? <&&&> $ 850 a month . <&&&> Does the rent include utilities ? <&&&> No .

And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot . <&&&> I think the Romans do what everyone else does . <&&&> Certainly . <&&&> And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself .

So I forgot the time . <&&&> Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . <&&&> Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . <&&&> It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . <&&&> Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . <&&&> Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? <&&&> No , but tell me some . I am interested . <&&&> Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition . <&&&> Are there many people there ?

Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! <&&&> Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . <&&&> OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? <&&&> Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . <&&&> Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? <&&&> Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . <&&&> Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? <&&&> Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! <&&&> Is that how you feel on the bus ? Whose handset sounds so beautiful <&&&> Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? <&&&> Are you able to compose music ? Would you go to the bookstore with me ? <&&&> It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go . How are your wedding plans going ? <&&&> Very well . We ’ Ve got everything taken care of already . <&&&> Are you going to get married in the church ? Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health . But you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play . <&&&> What I cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk . What are you doing over the weekend ? <&&&> I'm planing to go bolling tonight.Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie.What about you ? <&&&> I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . Welcome to our company . <&&&> I really love this kind of atmosphere . How much will it be all together ? Have you watched today's news ? <&&&> No , I haven't . What's going on ? <&&&> Did you hear about last night's blackout ? <&&&> Yes . The lights were out all night . <&&&> Some people went looting because of the blackout . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> People decided to use the blackout to their advantage . <&&&> People went out and looted ? Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . <&&&> I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? <&&&> I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . <&&&> I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . Two burgers , please . Are you aware of the reason why I pulled you over ? <&&&> No , sir . <&&&> I pulled you over because your brake light is out . <&&&> I'm sorry . I did not know that . <&&&> I have to write you a ticket . Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine . <&&&> Here . Are you all right ? <&&&> Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache . <&&&> I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor . <&&&> No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining . <&&&> Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . <&&&> I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . <&&&> You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever . <&&&> Do I ? Oh , no . <&&&> Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ? <&&&> What about Mr.White ? <&&&> I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work . Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Some friends of mine are going to visit me this evening . Would you please buy some fruit for me ? <&&&> Yes , sir . Do you need some flowers ? <&&&> That's a good idea . Can you help me to get some ? <&&&> Certainly , sir . What kind of flowers would you like ? <&&&> A basket of lilies . <&&&> You need fruit and lilies . Am I right ? Hey , Jim , it ’ s time to wake up and get out of bed . <&&&> Do I have to get up now ? <&&&> You ’ d better get up , or you ’ ll be late . <&&&> What are you talking about ? My alarm hasn ’ t even gone off yet . <&&&> Yes , it did . It went off 30 minutes ago . You slept right through it . You ’ re like a dead person while you sleep . Ben , what are you doing ? <&&&> Well , I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - here , in the pool . <&&&> Why ? What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! <&&&> You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? <&&&> From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? <&&&> Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! <&&&> Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . <&&&> He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! <&&&> She's chic , isn't she ? <&&&> Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . <&&&> It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . <&&&> Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . <&&&> Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . <&&&> I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! <&&&> The gown is quite expensive , believe me . <&&&> So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . <&&&> You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . <&&&> You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . <&&&> Thanks . I'm flattered . Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? <&&&> There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia .

Have you got any certificate of technical qualification ? <&&&> Yes , I have obtained an accountant's qualification and a driver's license . Who's that striking woman over there ? <&&&> Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . <&&&> Really ? Why not ? She looks great . <&&&> Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . <&&&> Really ? Tell me more . <&&&> Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . <&&&> Wow , crikey . So what happened ? <&&&> Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day . Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? <&&&> Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . <&&&> Oh , what ’ s she like ? <&&&> She is beautiful . <&&&> Is she old or young ? <&&&> She is quite young and her hair is blond . <&&&> Is she strict ? <&&&> Not really . Her eyes are blue . <&&&> Can she speak Chinese ? <&&&> Not much . She is very tall and slim . Did you promise me to get the bread ? <&&&> Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . <&&&> But you forgot to get the bread . <&&&> I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . <&&&> Well , I certainly did . So , you know how to drive , right ? <&&&> I'm pretty good . <&&&> Do you think you can teach me ? <&&&> Did you get your learner's permit yet ? <&&&> I have it already . <&&&> Do you have any experience driving a car ? <&&&> I've only done it once . <&&&> Do you know all the controls in the car ?

I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! <&&&> Are you trying to lose weight ? Hello . Dr . Brown ’ s Dental Office . How can I help you ? <&&&> Hi , this is Susan Smith . I ’ m calling about my appointment with Doctor Brown today at 3 <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> I got the flu . I have a fever and a headache . Can I cancel my appointment ? <&&&> Sure , you can , but you ’ ll be charged for $ 10 . <&&&> Oh , there ’ s a charge ? Why ? <&&&> This is for the delayed cancellation . Because this time is reserved for you . If you are unable to keep an appointment , you should notify us 48 hours in advance . Otherwise , the charge will be made . <&&&> I see . That ’ s ok . I ’ ll pay . <&&&> Thanks for your understanding . Do you want to make another appointment ? <&&&> No . Not right now . When I feel better I ’ ll call you again . Excuse me , I need your assistance . <&&&> Sure , what's up ? What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . <&&&> It's us . <&&&> What do you mean by us ? <&&&> Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember ? <&&&> What do you mean ? We're talking now , aren't we ? <&&&> Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . <&&&> Yes . I remember.But we never used to argue.You used to think I was wonderful.Where are you going ? One of my students told me she was very depressed today . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> Her father is dying . <&&&> Oh , that ’ s very sad . <&&&> Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . <&&&> What did you do ? <&&&> I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . <&&&> That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . Hello ? <&&&> Good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . <&&&> Good morning . <&&&> The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . <&&&> Oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . <&&&> She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . <&&&> Is there someone else I can talk to ? <&&&> She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? <&&&> Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . <&&&> Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? <&&&> I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ? <&&&> He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? <&&&> He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . <&&&> It must be hard being a father . <&&&> No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . I found an apartment to rent . <&&&> Where did you find this apartment ? <&&&> I found it in today ’ s apartment ads . <&&&> Really ? I can ’ t believe you actually found an apartment in the ads . <&&&> I actually found it in the ads , and it ’ s not too expensive either . What a mess , Jack ! I am so busy today . <&&&> Can I help you ? <&&&> I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . My , it looks too queer ! <&&&> Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect . <&&&> Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ? <&&&> Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken . <&&&> That sounds very interesting ! <&&&> Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine . Are you ready to order now , sir ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Would you like an appetizer ? <&&&> Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . There ’ s a letter here for you . <&&&> Let me see it . <&&&> What ’ s the letter about ? <&&&> It ’ s a letter from NYU . <&&&> Tell me what it says ! <&&&> I didn ’ t get in . <&&&> You ’ re lying . <&&&> I ’ m not lying . <&&&> Are you upset ? <&&&> I had high hopes for NYU . Did I do well on my test ? <&&&> Do you want to know the honest answer ? <&&&> Why wouldn't I want to know ? <&&&> You had pretty bad scores . <&&&> Exactly what do you mean by bad ? <&&&> You failed . <&&&> How'd I fail it ? Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ? <&&&> What kind of cottons are they ? May I see your list ? Ah , machine prints . <&&&> Yes , mainly prints . There are a few plain as well . Here they are . <&&&> I see . And the quantities . <&&&> 200 rolls of each . Make it 200 rolls for each sample . <&&&> How many rolls altogether ? <&&&> Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all . <&&&> Six weeks , did you say ? <&&&> Yes , five to six weeks . How much are these in all ? <&&&> It comes to $ 40 . Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? <&&&> It was okay . <&&&> Would you like a drink ? <&&&> No thanks , I'm not thirsty . <&&&> Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? <&&&> Not really . <&&&> Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? <&&&> Yes I did . <&&&> Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ? <&&&> Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ? <&&&> I never had a home inspection before . <&&&> I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through . <&&&> I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house . <&&&> The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future . <&&&> I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes . What would be a good day to finally move into the house ? <&&&> You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night . When you actually move in is up to you . <&&&> Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ? <&&&> Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in . <&&&> The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color . <&&&> An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in . <&&&> I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house . You know Iden , I don ’ t know much about you . Where were you born ? <&&&> I was born in London , but I spent most of my childhood in Hongkong . <&&&> What was your childhood like ? <&&&> I had a pretty strict up-bring , and my parents and I were always fighting about it . <&&&> Do you get along with your parents now ? <&&&> Oh , sure . Once they reached middle age , they became a lot less uptight . <&&&> Where did you go to university ? <&&&> My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong , but I decided to go back to England , I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature . Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! <&&&> You think ? <&&&> Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . <&&&> But I still get stuck on the different tones.It drives me crazy . Is Tom available please ? <&&&> He's on the other line , can you hold for a minute ? May I help you ? <&&&> I want to file a complaint . <&&&> What's the problem ? <&&&> A man robbed me today . <&&&> When ? What is your greatest strength ? <&&&> I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . <&&&> What is your weakness ? <&&&> I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . <&&&> What is your greatest accomplishment ? <&&&> I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . <&&&> Can you work under pressure ? <&&&> Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . Hello , Betty , how are you ? <&&&> Quite well , Tom.And you ? <&&&> Just fine , thank you.How ' s your father today ? <&&&> He's much better today . <&&&> I'm glad to hear that.Bye . How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? <&&&> Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . <&&&> Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? <&&&> I like taking photos out of doors . <&&&> Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . <&&&> Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . <&&&> You yourself have a photo studio ? Good morning , Miss Li . <&&&> Morning , Mike . <&&&> I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . <&&&> I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? <&&&> I feel much better now . Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . Hello , this is Francis . <&&&> Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . <&&&> Today , I am busy all day long . <&&&> Shall I see you on Friday morning ? How's your job search going ? <&&&> I only started looking for a job a few days ago . <&&&> have you finished compiling your resume ? <&&&> yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? <&&&> that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . <&&&> absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . <&&&> good . How about your cover letter ? <&&&> a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? <&&&> no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of <&&&> sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . <&&&> yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . <&&&> It is called Energy Collector . <&&&> Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ? <&&&> Maybe . Oh . I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it.It was very exciting . <&&&> I want to have a try later . <&&&> Me , too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? <&&&> Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . Oh , no . It looks like we're late . <&&&> Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . <&&&> There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? <&&&> They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . <&&&> That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? <&&&> why ? Did tom pop the question ? <&&&> not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . <&&&> let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? <&&&> you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . <&&&> I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . <&&&> oh , how did you deal with it ? <&&&> I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . <&&&> oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? <&&&> simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . Ah ! No ! Damn it ! <&&&> It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . <&&&> So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . <&&&> Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? <&&&> No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . <&&&> I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . <&&&> I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . <&&&> What are we going to do now ? <&&&> I don't know . I feel like going out . <&&&> I wonder how much of the city is down . <&&&> It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . <&&&> Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . <&&&> Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . <&&&> I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . <&&&> Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? <&&&> I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . <&&&> Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? <&&&> No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . Look what you've done ! <&&&> I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . <&&&> Yes , and hurry up ! <&&&> I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? <&&&> No , I'll do it myself . <&&&> Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? <&&&> I should think so , too ! <&&&> I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . <&&&> Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! <&&&> I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . I've got to go home and study . Helen , you must be excited at going to America to study . <&&&> Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages . I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? <&&&> Oh , yes , it was very interesting . <&&&> What were the schools like ? <&&&> Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . <&&&> But you taught children , yes ? <&&&> Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . <&&&> They actually study after school ? <&&&> That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . <&&&> Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? <&&&> Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . <&&&> Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . <&&&> So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . <&&&> But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . <&&&> As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ? <&&&> The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products . <&&&> I see . <&&&> If you need any further information , please don't hesitate to ask me . Do you know which bus will take me from PHS to Sons ? <&&&> Which Sons do you want to go to ? <&&&> It's on Fair Oaks and Orange Grove . <&&&> You actually need to catch two buses . <&&&> Okay , which ones do I need to take ? <&&&> The first bus you need to get on is the 268 . Evening , table for three , please . Come here ! I can see the tall camphor trees from here . <&&&> Yes , we can also see some yew trees . <&&&> This is a great botanical garden in the city . <&&&> Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . <&&&> Yeah , I agree.It makes you feel really good . <&&&> What are those . Miss Liu ? Are you satisfied with the dishes ? <&&&> Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . <&&&> I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . <&&&> Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 <&&&> If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? <&&&> Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . <&&&> Great , I love hot food too . <&&&> Well , let's finish this great dinner first . I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . <&&&> That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? <&&&> Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? <&&&> Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . You don't look too well . What's going on ? <&&&> I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . <&&&> I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? <&&&> I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . <&&&> That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? Did you hear something ? You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? <&&&> I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . <&&&> What was your childhood like ? <&&&> I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me . Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . <&&&> Yes , it has been a long time ! How can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . I think what I am using now does not fit me well . Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . <&&&> Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! <&&&> Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . <&&&> All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! <&&&> Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . <&&&> Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . <&&&> It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . Jill , how do you like your new job ? <&&&> I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . <&&&> I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . <&&&> Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . <&&&> Sure , I think I know the place . So , Emily , how was your day ? <&&&> I don't think you really want to hear about it . <&&&> It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . <&&&> To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! <&&&> Why ? What happened ? <&&&> Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! <&&&> That's not very fair . What did you do ? <&&&> There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . <&&&> Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? <&&&> He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! <&&&> Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? <&&&> I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! <&&&> Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? <&&&> Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! <&&&> Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . <&&&> Yeah , that's right . If no one sends me text messages , I'll go crazy . <&&&> Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . <&&&> Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! <&&&> Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? <&&&> Absolutely . <&&&> Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? <&&&> Yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . <&&&> Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? <&&&> Sure , I have . Will you join ? Can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to buy a skirt . <&&&> What style would you prefer ? <&&&> I like one with flowers on its brim . <&&&> Do you like this one ? <&&&> It seems too short . <&&&> What about this one ? <&&&> It looks nice . How much is it ? <&&&> 70 yuan . <&&&> Is there any cheaper one ? <&&&> This one is only 50 yuan . <&&&> I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now . It is better than this one although this one is cheaper . Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? What did you say ? <&&&> I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? <&&&> Well , I feel a little tired . <&&&> Come on ! A little labor , much health . I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ? <&&&> sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? <&&&> how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them . <&&&> dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! <&&&> well , what do you have in mind ? <&&&> how about the Mongolian hot pot ? <&&&> oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up ! <&&&> maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . Shall I take a photo of you ? <&&&> Could you ? Thank you . <&&&> You ’ re welcome . What brings you to China ? <&&&> I ’ m actually here on business . <&&&> I see and what do you do for a living ? <&&&> I ’ m an IT salesman . <&&&> That sounds like a good job . <&&&> It ’ s very interesting actually . <&&&> Ok , well enjoy the rest of your stay here . Are you ready to go the concert ? I heard you received a prize for you book . <&&&> yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . <&&&> congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . <&&&> actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . Is there anything I can do for you ? <&&&> I'm looking for a black , leather bag . <&&&> How's this ? Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? <&&&> That depends . What does she look like ? <&&&> Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . <&&&> How tall is she ? <&&&> She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . <&&&> Is she chubby ? <&&&> Not at all . She's actually very athletic . <&&&> It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? <&&&> No , but she does wear contact lenses . <&&&> How's her skin ? <&&&> She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . Good morning , Miss . <&&&> Morning . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . <&&&> All you need is your student identification card to check out books . <&&&> Yes.Here ' s my identification . May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? <&&&> Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . <&&&> I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . <&&&> I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . <&&&> Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . <&&&> Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . <&&&> Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . <&&&> But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? Next please . Hello . How can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to buy a ticket for New York . <&&&> Would you like one way or round trip ? <&&&> Round trip . <&&&> When will you be leaving ? <&&&> When does the next plane leave ? <&&&> In about 2 hours . <&&&> I'd like a ticket for that flight please . I'll always remember my college days . Steven , what are you thinking about ? <&&&> Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . <&&&> Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . <&&&> I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . <&&&> What do you mean ? <&&&> Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . <&&&> I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . <&&&> People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . <&&&> I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . <&&&> I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? <&&&> Two . French and Spanish . <&&&> And how well can you speak them ? <&&&> Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . <&&&> And how about your Spanish ? Do you speak a foreign language ? <&&&> Yes . I am capable of speaking English smoothly . I have been learning English for years . Brian , a company called me for an interview . <&&&> That's great ! You need to prepare for it . <&&&> How ? <&&&> Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . <&&&> Okay . <&&&> Buy an expensive suit . <&&&> How expensive ? <&&&> The more expensive , the better . <&&&> I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? <&&&> That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . <&&&> How ? <&&&> If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine . <&&&> Is a white blouse okay ? <&&&> Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . <&&&> Black ? <&&&> Black is good . <&&&> White pantyhose ? <&&&> No . Dark or skin colored . <&&&> Jewelry ? <&&&> Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . <&&&> How about make up ? I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? <&&&> He's not doing too well . <&&&> Why ? What's wrong ? <&&&> About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . <&&&> Is it due to old age or is he sick . <&&&> Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . How did you do on your BELTS exam ? <&&&> Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . <&&&> That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? <&&&> Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . <&&&> Do you know where the visa office is ? Caroline Menzies speaking . <&&&> Could I speak to Diana Curzon ? <&&&> I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ? <&&&> This is John Laing from Dantons . <&&&> Can I take a message , Mr Laing ? <&&&> Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called . <&&&> Certainly . Does she have your number ? <&&&> She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 . <&&&> 01705 ... <&&&> 455623 . Have you bought a lot of new clothes for your vacation ? Could I ask the company for the housing ? Are you being served , sir ? Do you enjoy going on dates ? <&&&> Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun . <&&&> What's so fun about them ? <&&&> They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better . <&&&> So you always have fun on dates ? <&&&> Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with . Do you know why I pulled you over ? <&&&> I have no idea . <&&&> Your left brake light is out . <&&&> I was not aware of that . <&&&> I'm going to have to write you a ticket . <&&&> You can't give me a break ? <&&&> I'm just doing my job . do you have s second ? What do you think of the apartment ? <&&&> I like it , but there is one problem . <&&&> What problem is that ? How did you spend the weekend ? <&&&> I went to a movie with my boyfriend . <&&&> Really ? How was it ? <&&&> It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . <&&&> Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? <&&&> Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Bourbon , please . <&&&> How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ? <&&&> With iced water , please . <&&&> Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water . <&&&> Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ? What do you base our grades on ? <&&&> All of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester . <&&&> Does the final count the most ? <&&&> All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times . <&&&> How do you total our scores ? <&&&> The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest . <&&&> What if we are out sick ? <&&&> Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence . Hello , Is this EYE computers ? Hello . This is the Customer service . How can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ Ve been getting harassing calls recently . Can I have my phone number changed ? <&&&> Sure . What ’ s your favorite number ? <&&&> How about 560 436 4040 . <&&&> I ’ m sorry . This number has already been registered . <&&&> How about 560-436-8976 ? <&&&> This number is ok . It ’ s still available . When would you like your phone number changed ? <&&&> As soon as possible . Can I have it right now ? What is the best way to find a job here ? <&&&> There are different ways of conducting a job search . Do you know what you want to do ? <&&&> I don't know . <&&&> Can you work part-time or full-time ? It looks like it's going to be sunny . <&&&> Yes , it's much better than yesterday . <&&&> They say we're going to get some rain later . Have you gone to school today ? <&&&> I went to school today . Did you go to school ? <&&&> I couldn't go to school today , I was sick . <&&&> That's horrible . I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class . The time has come to say goodbye . <&&&> So soon . It seems as if you just got here . <&&&> I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . <&&&> It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . <&&&> I've had a delightful time and I really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights . <&&&> It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different . <&&&> You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? <&&&> Oh , yes . I should be there sometime next spring . I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised . <&&&> Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated . Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? <&&&> The same question to you . <&&&> Well , we shall make it a secret between us . <&&&> Deal , Where is Gucci ? <&&&> She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . <&&&> Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . <&&&> I want to be like her . <&&&> Get real . Don't be so pathetic . Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ? <&&&> Sure . Let me get it for you . <&&&> Can you also show me this one ? <&&&> No problem . This one is made of pure gold . <&&&> I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful . <&&&> You ’ re right . This one costs less , but is more beautiful . <&&&> Will the luster fade out after some time ? What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! <&&&> You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? <&&&> From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? Guess what I've brought for you . <&&&> Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . May I help you ? <&&&> I have a problem . <&&&> What ’ s your problem ? <&&&> I owe fees , but a bank statement never came in the mail about it . <&&&> I apologize for the inconvenience . <&&&> I have no idea about the fee , so my fees went up . <&&&> I understand your problem . <&&&> Will you be able to solve my problem ? <&&&> I ’ m going to cancel the fees you owe . Could we have the honor of you presence of the meeting ? <&&&> I'm awfully sorry , I have other plan . <&&&> Would you prefer some other time ? <&&&> I'd love to come other time if it can be arranged . <&&&> Are you quite sure you can come next Tuesday ? <&&&> Certainly , I'll be going . <&&&> What time am I supposed to pick you up ? When is your vacation going to start ? <&&&> I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation <&&&> Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ? <&&&> I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter . <&&&> Where are you going now . <&&&> To the beach <&&&> Have you made your hotel reservation yet ? I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . <&&&> My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? <&&&> Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . <&&&> What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . <&&&> That was last time . This time it's worse . <&&&> Ok , tell me . <&&&> Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... <&&&> And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . <&&&> True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... <&&&> Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . <&&&> And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . <&&&> At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . <&&&> Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America . <&&&> We have some catalogues from U . S . universities . You may check in the reference stacks over there . <&&&> Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ? <&&&> Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th . <&&&> Oh , no . It's already February 5th . Merry Christmas ! <&&&> Huh ? <&&&> I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? <&&&> It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . <&&&> Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? <&&&> Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . I am starving . <&&&> Didn't you just eat ? <&&&> I'm still hungry . <&&&> We ate everything from dinner . <&&&> I just need a snack . <&&&> What are you going to make ? <&&&> I don't have the slightest clue . <&&&> Go make a sandwich . Do you want some dessert ? <&&&> No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? <&&&> Oh , here comes our waitress with our check . <&&&> The service here has been really great , don't you think ? <&&&> Yes , the service was quite good . <&&&> So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 . <&&&> How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? <&&&> Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . Hey , what's up ? <&&&> Oh , nothing . <&&&> What were you writing ? <&&&> ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . <&&&> You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! <&&&> I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . <&&&> But , you work with her everyday . <&&&> That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . <&&&> You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? <&&&> Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . <&&&> Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . <&&&> What note ? <&&&> I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . <&&&> You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . I would like high speed internet installed in my house . <&&&> You have to make an appointment before we can come out and install it . <&&&> I'd like to make an appointment right now . <&&&> What day are you available ? <&&&> I would like to have it done this Friday . <&&&> Three o'clock is the only time we can come in . <&&&> Is it possible for someone to come a little earlier ? <&&&> I'm sorry , but that's our only available time . <&&&> How about Saturday ? The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn . <&&&> Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . <&&&> What is this test for ? <&&&> Well , today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count . <&&&> What does that tell him ? <&&&> Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection . I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . <&&&> Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . <&&&> What does it come with standard ? <&&&> On all our new cars , the standards include <&&&> Cruise control ? I don't like that . <&&&> Why not , sir ? <&&&> I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? <&&&> Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . Would you like chicken or beef ? <&&&> Chicken , please . <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> Thank you . Oh , can I have another drink ? Hello , I am Richard from the Brooks Head-hunter company . Can I have a private talk with you ? <&&&> Er ? I am driving right now . Can you call back in 30 minutes ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> Hi , Monica , Richard again . Have you ever heard about our company ? It is an international one with good reputation . We have a lot of successful cases . If you ’ re trying advance your career , I would love to help you . XYZ Company is one of our clients . They ’ re in need of the talent like you . Would you be interested in taking part in an interview ? It is scheduled some time within this week . <&&&> Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . <&&&> Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about our company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address . <&&&> Well , I will text it to you . Thank you , bye for now . Dad , when will you finish your cooking ? <&&&> Several minutes . <&&&> So what should I do now ? <&&&> Then , pass me a bowl for the soup . <&&&> Where's the bowl gone ? <&&&> Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! <&&&> Dad ? <&&&> Check the drawer . <&&&> OK , got it , but its shape is so strange . I don't like it . <&&&> Can it hold soup ? <&&&> Maybe . <&&&> It smells sweet . Mom and May are gonna love it . Get them for dinner , Daniel ! Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? <&&&> Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ? <&&&> No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? <&&&> Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop . <&&&> I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . <&&&> I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . <&&&> So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . Good morning , Mr . Smith . How do Mark and Jones compare , in your opinion ? <&&&> Generally speaking , Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones <&&&> May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ? Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ? Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? <&&&> Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . <&&&> I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . <&&&> I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . <&&&> What's your proposal then ? Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . <&&&> I would need to check on that . Where is the fundraiser ? <&&&> It will be at the beach by the pier . <&&&> What day will you need it for ? So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ? <&&&> Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! <&&&> So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? <&&&> Yes . One bedroom is for my wife and I . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen . <&&&> What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . <&&&> That ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . <&&&> Are the rooms nice and bright ? <&&&> Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . <&&&> Do you have a balcony ? <&&&> No , we don ’ t . We wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . What can I help you with today ? <&&&> I need to check out this book . <&&&> Do you have your library card ? Good morning , sir.Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to see the manager.Here ' s my card . Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? <&&&> Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? <&&&> Alright . Do you have a coin ? <&&&> Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . <&&&> Heads . <&&&> Sorry , it's tails . You lose . <&&&> Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . <&&&> Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? <&&&> No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . <&&&> Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . <&&&> Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? <&&&> Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? <&&&> Yes , I agree . <&&&> So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . <&&&> Alright . <&&&> I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . <&&&> Is that right ? <&&&> Yes , that's right . <&&&> Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . <&&&> Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . <&&&> Are all lucky people so stuck up ? <&&&> C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . <&&&> Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . <&&&> Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ? <&&&> I will go get something to eat . You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack . Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . <&&&> Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . <&&&> Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . <&&&> It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . <&&&> It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? <&&&> Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? <&&&> That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . What can I help you with today ? <&&&> When does the library close ? <&&&> The library closes at six o ’ clock . <&&&> Does it close at that time every day ? <&&&> Not always . Why should I buy this MD player ? <&&&> Well , it has a lithium battery that lasts for 24 hours and it has a 160 second anti-skip mode for when you're playing sports . <&&&> What else ? <&&&> Using MP3 mode , you can download about 10 hours of music from either your CD player , or your computer's hard disk onto one mini-disk . <&&&> But how's the sound quality ? <&&&> You can choose from several play modes , or you can use the full-spectrum equalization , 3 D mode and Mega Bass features . We rec-ommend using it with the studio monitor headphones . I heard you are looking for a house . <&&&> Yes . <&&&> How is this going ? <&&&> I haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet . <&&&> I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer . <&&&> Where is the house ? <&&&> It is on Spring Avenue . <&&&> Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? <&&&> It ’ s $ 240 a month . <&&&> Does that include utilities ? <&&&> It includes water , but not gas and electricity . <&&&> That ’ s a little expensive . <&&&> But it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work . <&&&> Yes . I won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . Is it a one-bedroom apartment ? Good afternoon , how can I help ? Hello , Fairbrook Consulting , how may I help you ? <&&&> Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal . <&&&> Certainly , what day were you thinking of ? You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ? <&&&> Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting . <&&&> Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . <&&&> It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? <&&&> Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . <&&&> Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? <&&&> No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . Let's see now . Cut the potatoes into small cubes . <&&&> Yes , but don't cut them yet . Wait until they cool . Where is the big plastic bowl ? <&&&> On the bottom shelf in the cupboard under the sink . <&&&> What's Donna like , by the way ? <&&&> Donna ? Well . She is about 20 . She is very lovely and I think you will like her . What about Paul ? <&&&> Oh , Paul is very easy-going and friendly . I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process . Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? <&&&> We can take a bus there . Do you have any questions you want to ask ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to know if there would be any future opportunities for specific training . <&&&> If necessary there will be . Any other questions ? <&&&> When will I know your decision ? May I help you with something ? <&&&> I would like to return these books . <&&&> What happened to this book ? <&&&> I dropped it , and the cover tore off . <&&&> I ’ m going to have to charge you for the damage . <&&&> How much ? I wish you wouldn't play the TV so loud . <&&&> Sorry . Were you trying to sleep ? Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! <&&&> Is everything OK ? <&&&> Just get over here ! <&&&> Come in ! Quickly ! <&&&> So , since when is your house a bank ? <&&&> What do you mean ? May I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes , please . I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother . He's going to take a trip to South America . <&&&> By air or by sea ? <&&&> By air . So my gift should be quite light . What can you suggest ? <&&&> How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather . <&&&> My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual . The time has come to say goodbye . <&&&> So soon . It seems as if you just got here . <&&&> I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . <&&&> It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . <&&&> I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around . <&&&> It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine . <&&&> You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? <&&&> Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring . Why don't we get you some shirts ? <&&&> I want to leave . We've already been here two hours . <&&&> But we should get you some shirts while we're here . You need summer shirts . <&&&> I would rather buy them somewhere else . <&&&> Why ? They have everything here . <&&&> I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety . <&&&> Let's just look and see what they have . <&&&> Alright . <&&&> What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ? <&&&> The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping . <&&&> Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . <&&&> Sure I would . <&&&> Here . Look at this shirt . Try it on . <&&&> Do they have it in LARGE . <&&&> I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on . <&&&> Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it . <&&&> The fitting rooms are over there . <&&&> Okay , I will try it on . <&&&> It looks good on you . <&&&> I look like a nerd . <&&&> No , it looks great.Why are you always like this when you're shopping ? You know it looks good . <&&&> Well , I don't think it's the best style for me . <&&&> I think we'll buy this one . And I want you to try on this one too . Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? <&&&> Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . <&&&> So , what changed ? <&&&> Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . Can you skillfully operate the computer ? <&&&> Yes , I can . I have three years experience in operating computers . <&&&> What kind of software can you use ? <&&&> I can skillfully use Dos , Windows . <&&&> Do you have any certificates on computer ? <&&&> Yes , I have ACRE certificate , rank 2 . <&&&> Any other certificates ? <&&&> Yes , I have a Cambridge Business English Certificate and Lawyer ’ s Qualification Certificate . Good morning , Family . We'll have our board meeting this afternoon . Can you write the agenda on the notice board ? <&&&> What will you discuss at the meeting ? <&&&> We'll talk about the financial report for the first half of the year . <&&&> And anything else ? What should we do this Saturday ? <&&&> Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday . <&&&> Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good . <&&&> The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five . How are you ? <&&&> I ’ m fabulous . <&&&> What can I help you with ? <&&&> I need to make a withdrawal . which countries have you been to ? <&&&> I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada . <&&&> I thought you had been to Australia too . Good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . <&&&> Certainly . For how many people ? <&&&> We ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? <&&&> I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ? <&&&> About 7 thirty . <&&&> Yes . That ’ s fine . We can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . Could you give me your name please ? <&&&> My name is Jenkins . My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7 thirty on Friday . <&&&> Yes . Do you intend to order a Lacarne or will you be having our seafood buffet ? I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . <&&&> You're so careless , Billy . First of all , thank you for accepting this job . <&&&> It ’ s my pleasure . <&&&> What are your salary expectations ? <&&&> Would you please tell me about your pay skill first ? Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? <&&&> Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . <&&&> That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? <&&&> It was a nightmare . <&&&> What ’ s up ? <&&&> Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . <&&&> Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? <&&&> Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . <&&&> This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? Waiter , I would like to order now . <&&&> Sure . What do you want to have today ? <&&&> Cream soup and steak , please . I need help finding a gift for my daughter . <&&&> Would she like a laptop ? <&&&> That sounds like a good idea . <&&&> A Mac is a very popular brand . <&&&> She mentioned a Mac . How much is it ? <&&&> A 15 - inch Pro model is $ 2,100 plus tax . <&&&> That sounds like a great price . I'll take one . <&&&> This is a gift she'll cherish for years . How do you want to pay ? Are you going to vote ? <&&&> I am . Are you ? <&&&> Yes , and for the first time . <&&&> Is that right ? <&&&> I don ’ t know how to vote . <&&&> Voting isn ’ t difficult . Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? <&&&> Fine ! How are you ? <&&&> I'm fine too , thank you . <&&&> I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . Hello , there . Welcome , and what can we assist you with ? <&&&> Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it . Is that possible here ? <&&&> Yes , we can do that . We require the original Trading Contract and also the VAT Invoice and the Commodity Delivery Documents . They all need to be in duplicate . Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? <&&&> Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? <&&&> Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? I ’ ll be away for a moment . With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? <&&&> What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? <&&&> Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . <&&&> So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? How may I help you ? <&&&> I want to return this video . <&&&> Is that all you need ? <&&&> I also need to check this magazine out . <&&&> You ’ re not allowed to do that . <&&&> I don ’ t understand . <&&&> It ’ s our policy . <&&&> What can I check out ? <&&&> Only books or videos . I'm so hungry ! I haven't late eaten all day ! <&&&> Take your mind off it . Look , Crys.This magazine is on China's top ten beauties ! <&&&> They're all so thin ! Her cheekbones are great . <&&&> She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face . <&&&> The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos . If only we could be that thin then ... <&&&> Not even drinking milk for one month would get us like that . <&&&> Oh , bathroom blues . <&&&> Look at this girl's gray dress . <&&&> I went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small . <&&&> Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade . <&&&> ( Weigh herself ) Hey , I lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet . If I keep going , I can wear that dress next month . Are you doing anything tonight ? What happened to your brother ? <&&&> It seems that he has gone ape over the girl . <&&&> Your parents must be worrying about him . <&&&> Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do . How are you , Sue ? <&&&> Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . <&&&> Congratulations on your success . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> And how ’ s your brother ? <&&&> He is fine . <&&&> He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? <&&&> Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? <&&&> Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time . <&&&> Are all of your team members on schedule ? <&&&> A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems . <&&&> How have they decided to deal with that ? <&&&> They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend . I need to order new business cards . <&&&> Do you have any idea how many you'd like ? Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ? <&&&> OK . When ? <&&&> At 10 o'clock . <&&&> 10 in the morning ? Professor Wang , what is non-tariff barrier ? <&&&> Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports . <&&&> Can you give an example ? <&&&> For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction . We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend . <&&&> What's the weather going to be like ? I may want to go too . <&&&> The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm . <&&&> Will it be good beach weather ? Good morning . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me . <&&&> I'm sorry to hear that . This room is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when everything is quiet . May I speak to Marry ? <&&&> Marry is not in right now , she went shopping with her mum . <&&&> Will it be too late if I call around ten this evening ? I'd love that . I'm so glad I quit . It's time for a change . <&&&> Does that mean you're going to take my advice ? <&&&> Yes . I'm looking for a position as a chef . <&&&> I might be able to help ... <&&&> I'm sure you have great connections . <&&&> We'd like to open another restaurant ... with you as the head chef and manager ... <&&&> Really ? You have that much faith in me ? And Giovanni agreed to it ? Does he know who I am ? <&&&> Yes . But you know him . He's just worried that you're not Italian ... <&&&> He's prejudiced , isn't he ? <&&&> No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . He followed me all the way home ! Are you ready ? <&&&> Ready for what ? <&&&> Ready for the big switch . <&&&> What are you talking about ? <&&&> The nation is switching to digital TV . <&&&> Oh . Of course I'm ready . Have you packed our passports ? <&&&> Not yet . Do we need to take it with us ? Well , what's the matter with you ? Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? <&&&> Yes , they all stop at this corner . <&&&> I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street.Can I take any bus that comes along ? <&&&> You can take any bus except the Number 9 . <&&&> How often do the buses run ? <&&&> They run about every five minutes . Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? <&&&> Sure , I have . Will you join ? <&&&> I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . <&&&> You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . <&&&> I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . <&&&> Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . <&&&> Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? Hello . Is Bob there , please ? <&&&> Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . <&&&> Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ? <&&&> He will be back at about seven o'clock . <&&&> Can I leave a message please ? <&&&> Yes , certainly . Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? <&&&> I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! <&&&> What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? <&&&> It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? <&&&> January 5th . <&&&> Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! <&&&> That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment . <&&&> I am kind of busy right now , but maybe later next week I could stop by . <&&&> We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in ; it listed the problems we found . <&&&> What problems did you find ? <&&&> The roof leaks when it rains , there is mold on the bedroom walls , and the dishwasher doesn ’ t work . <&&&> I don ’ t really consider any of that to be my responsibility . You can fix those things yourself . <&&&> Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility . <&&&> I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky ! <&&&> Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday . Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? <&&&> I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . <&&&> Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages . I ’ m so frustrated ! <&&&> what ’ s wrong , Jim ? <&&&> I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! Shall we go to a movie tonight ? <&&&> That's a good idea.What ' s on ? What do you think of your teacher ? <&&&> He's very strict with us . Good afternoon , madam . May I help you ? <&&&> Do you have some new perfume ? <&&&> I am sorry , madam . I didn't hear you . It's too noisy here . Could you please say it again ? <&&&> Well , I wanna buy some new perfume . <&&&> Would you please wait a minute ? I will get one for you at once . <&&&> That's all right . <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> Can I open it ? <&&&> Yes , certainly , madam . How did you do on your BELTS exam ? <&&&> Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me . <&&&> No problem . What do you want me to get ? <&&&> Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get . <&&&> Did you forget to put anything on the list ? <&&&> I don't think I forgot anything . <&&&> Would you like me to go anywhere else for you ? <&&&> If you don't mind , I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription . <&&&> Has your prescription been filled yet ? <&&&> Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready . I have a suggestion . Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ? <&&&> A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ? <&&&> Yes , why not ? Don ’ t you like ETV ? <&&&> I don't know . I never went to one . <&&&> Never ? Really ? I'm surprised . <&&&> Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do . Are the children all grown up now , Rose ? <&&&> Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer . <&&&> Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading . <&&&> She ’ s a librarian at the public library . Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . <&&&> Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . <&&&> I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . <&&&> Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . <&&&> Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? <&&&> Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? <&&&> History . <&&&> Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your <&&&> Thirty percent ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? <&&&> Yes . It's an excellent system . <&&&> Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? <&&&> Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . <&&&> I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . <&&&> I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . <&&&> What ? Are you serious ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> But nobody uses Macintosh ! <&&&> That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma <&&&> Yes , I'm from Taiwan . <&&&> Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Do you have a reservation ? <&&&> Yes , I do . <&&&> May I have your name , please ? <&&&> Yes , it's Mr . Brown . <&&&> Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? What did you do at the office today ? <&&&> I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . <&&&> What kind of things did you need to check ? <&&&> The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! How ’ s it going ? <&&&> I ’ m fine , thank you . Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? <&&&> I like orange better . <&&&> Why ? You heard who won the election , right ? <&&&> Who was elected ? <&&&> McCain won the election . <&&&> That can ’ t be true ! <&&&> I ’ m upset , too . <&&&> I can ’ t believe people voted for him . <&&&> People must want him as our President . <&&&> That doesn ’ t make any sense . <&&&> I have more bad news . <&&&> How could the news get any worse ? <&&&> I was only kidding , because Obama won the election . Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ? <&&&> I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ? <&&&> I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . <&&&> Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists . <&&&> Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . <&&&> Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .

Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? <&&&> Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . <&&&> Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . <&&&> Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . <&&&> Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! <&&&> Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . <&&&> Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . <&&&> Thanks doc ! Have a nice weekend ! <&&&> Thanks.You too ! <&&&> Do you have any plans ? <&&&> Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? <&&&> Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda <&&&> Ok . <&&&> I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? What sport do you like the most ? <&&&> I like baseball the best . <&&&> Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? <&&&> Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . <&&&> What position did you play ? <&&&> I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . <&&&> I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . <&&&> It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? <&&&> I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . <&&&> I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . <&&&> I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? <&&&> When do you guys play ? Have you seen Bill recently ? <&&&> Yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now . <&&&> Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood . <&&&> You have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from Tom ? Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy . Sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ? I ’ ll be away for a moment . <&&&> Yes ? Anything I can do for you ? <&&&> Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? <&&&> Yes , but it's quite a ways . <&&&> Do I need to take a bus ? <&&&> This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes . <&&&> How do I get there on foot ? Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . <&&&> Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! <&&&> Thank you , shall I open it now ? <&&&> Yes , please do . <&&&> Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . Congratulations on the new house ! <&&&> Thanks ! We love it . Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ? <&&&> Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent . What would you like today ? <&&&> Let me get a hamburger . <&&&> Do you want cheese on it ? <&&&> No cheese . <&&&> Can I get you something to drink ? <&&&> Can I get a soda , please ? <&&&> What kind do you want ? <&&&> I'd like a Sprite . <&&&> Would you like anything else ? <&&&> I'd like a bag of Doritos with that . <&&&> Is that all ? The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? <&&&> it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . <&&&> well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? <&&&> of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! <&&&> Wow ! Sure ! <&&&> I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . <&&&> Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! <&&&> I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . <&&&> I'd love to help if I can . Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . <&&&> Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! <&&&> OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . <&&&> Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . <&&&> Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . <&&&> Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . <&&&> Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . <&&&> Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . <&&&> Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . <&&&> What are they ? <&&&> Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch . <&&&> Wow ! <&&&> Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . <&&&> Two waves ? When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ? <&&&> It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms.Barkley . Hey Mike . What are you doing ? <&&&> Nothing much . What are you up to ? Here's 30 yuan for my ticket . <&&&> Keep it . I'm buying tonight . <&&&> No , you can't do that . Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . <&&&> I feel kind of stupid . <&&&> Why ? <&&&> We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . <&&&> You got lost . You're kidding ! <&&&> No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . <&&&> You could have called . <&&&> I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . <&&&> You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? <&&&> Guess where we ended up . <&&&> I don't know . Where ? <&&&> When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . <&&&> Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? <&&&> I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . <&&&> Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . <&&&> I know it is . I don't know how it happened . <&&&> Hmm , maybe I do . <&&&> What ? <&&&> Maybe I have an idea how it happened . <&&&> How ? <&&&> You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . <&&&> Oh , that's what you think , huh ? How can I travel by air ? Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? Have you anything to declare ? <&&&> One bottle of perfume and a watch . <&&&> Where did you buy it ? <&&&> In Boston . <&&&> Do you travel a lot ? <&&&> Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . <&&&> Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ? <&&&> Nearly ten years . <&&&> I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ? <&&&> I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere.Would you like to see it ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to see the receipt.Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . Good evening . Welcome to our program . <&&&> Thank you . Good evening , Mr.Dean . <&&&> Would you tell us your name , please ? <&&&> I'm Helen Baker . <&&&> Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker . <&&&> Glad to meet you , too . Can you help me buy my textbooks ? <&&&> There will probably be a book list in the bookstore . Do you have your class schedule handy ? <&&&> No , I don't have that . <&&&> To get started , take that list over to the bookstore . Do you know where the bookstore is ? <&&&> I am not sure where the bookstore is . <&&&> When you pass the gym , it'll be the first door on the left . Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money ? <&&&> Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ? <&&&> If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door , he will reimburse you . Can you go over there today ? <&&&> I think maybe I could be there . Can I help you , Miss ? <&&&> Yes . I have just got lost with my firiend.Can you page my friend for me ? Print shop . Seam speaking . <&&&> Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office . I placed an order for 1,000 bound copies of a staff manual last week . <&&&> It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that . That dress is too expensive . <&&&> But it ’ s so pretty . <&&&> Yes , it is pretty , but it costs $ 200 . What about this one ? It ’ s almost the same , but it costs half as much . <&&&> It ’ s not the same . It ’ s completely different . I plan to buy a car this year . How do I set up an E-mail account ? Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot . <&&&> Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ? <&&&> No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it . <&&&> I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away . Mr . : Please open your books to page 10 . ( To Mary ) Can I help you ? <&&&> I'm sorry that I'm late . I couldn't find the room . <&&&> Mr . : That's alright . It's the first day of school , after all . do you believe in UFO's ? <&&&> sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . <&&&> I've never thought about it like that before . <&&&> I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . Do you like snakes ? <&&&> Of course not . I'm afraid of them . Have you washed any clothes yet ? <&&&> No , I've only washed my whites . <&&&> When you wash your dark clothes , can you put some of mine in ? <&&&> Sure . Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes ? <&&&> Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle . <&&&> How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash ? Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . <&&&> How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . <&&&> Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . <&&&> They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? <&&&> That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . <&&&> Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . <&&&> Have you heard Maria Carey ? <&&&> Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! <&&&> Just tell the truth . I won ’ t take it personally . <&&&> Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ? <&&&> Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please ! <&&&> Well . Since you ’ d like an honest answer , I will tell you the truth . Are you ready for your first driving lesson ? <&&&> Yes . Which one is the brake again ? <&&&> The pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . <&&&> I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . <&&&> Automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . <&&&> You should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! <&&&> Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? <&&&> I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? <&&&> How ’ s that ? What ’ s the matter , dear ? Are you okay ? <&&&> No . <&&&> What's wrong ? <&&&> I got robbed ! <&&&> By who ? <&&&> Some guy on the street just mugged me . <&&&> Are you hurt ? <&&&> No , he just stole all of my things . <&&&> That's crazy . <&&&> I need to go to the police station . <&&&> Do you want me to take you ? Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . I am calling to ask the position of HR manager . Could you tell me more about it ? <&&&> Yes . We are looking for someone who are well-educated and have all-round experience as a manager . Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . <&&&> Than you , I'm not late , am I ? <&&&> No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . <&&&> Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . <&&&> Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? <&&&> Please , I wish you would . <&&&> Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . May I help you , sir ? <&&&> I need a hat . Would you show me some ? I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . <&&&> That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? <&&&> I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? <&&&> I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . <&&&> Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . <&&&> I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . <&&&> So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . <&&&> Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . <&&&> You are very nice to tell me those . Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? <&&&> I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? <&&&> Three would be a good time . <&&&> Great , do you need directions to my office ? <&&&> I'm not sure . <&&&> Well , just make sure to go through the double doors , and I'll be on the right . What did you buy at the market ? <&&&> I bought some special local products . <&&&> You seem to have bought the whole market ! Good morning , sir , where are you going ? <&&&> I'm going to England by flight B . E . 987 . <&&&> When is your flight ? <&&&> 10:00 a . m . When am I supposed to check in ? <&&&> We are checking in . May I have your ticket ? And your health certificate and your luggage , please . <&&&> Here you are . <&&&> Are you keeping this small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ? Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . <&&&> To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . <&&&> What happened ? <&&&> First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . <&&&> What did your boss say ? <&&&> He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! <&&&> That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? <&&&> That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . <&&&> Is your boss Chinese ? <&&&> No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . <&&&> What are you going to do ? <&&&> I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . <&&&> That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? Joseph , who is that woman ? <&&&> That's Susan . Why is there no water coming out when you turn on the faucet ? <&&&> Not even a single drop ? Are you from America ? <&&&> No . I am Canadian . Are you Chinese ? <&&&> Yes . Nice to meet you ! <&&&> Nice to meet you , too . Let me show you around . <&&&> Thanks , I will appreciate it . How long have you been here ? The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? <&&&> It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . <&&&> Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? <&&&> Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... <&&&> Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . <&&&> You're dancing so well . <&&&> You dance beautifully too . There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask . <&&&> You know that I have no secrets toward you . Would you like to have this kind of suitcase ? Good morning , sir.Can I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to see the manager.Here ' s my card . <&&&> Thank you , Mr.Wang.Do you have an appointment ? <&&&> No , I'm afraid I don't . Is it possible for me to see him now ? <&&&> I'm afraid Mr.Li is engaged at the moment . Would you mind waiting ? <&&&> Well , how long will it be ? <&&&> About half an hour . <&&&> That's too bad . I can't wait that long . I have another appointment at ten . <&&&> Can the Assistant Manager meet you instead ? <&&&> No , I have discussed the details about sales of our new equipment with the manager on the telephone yesterday . I always think everybody looks down on me <&&&> Don't be that negative . <&&&> How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . Is there any cable for the Internet ? <&&&> Yes . From the looks of this house from the outside , I don ’ t really think that I want to go inside . Madam , what can I do for you ? <&&&> Next week there will be a meeting with the manager of USE Company ; this is an important opportunity for our company to have a new relationship with a new partner . So , I want you to prepare an instruction book with detailed introduction of our products . This introduction will be presented in the meeting . <&&&> I get it . And ... ? <&&&> Remember to add an agenda for this meeting and show our warm welcome to them . <&&&> How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ? I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . <&&&> Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . <&&&> Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . <&&&> Are you sure ? <&&&> Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . <&&&> Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? <&&&> Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . <&&&> Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? <&&&> Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . <&&&> And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . <&&&> I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . <&&&> Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . <&&&> We are nor alone here . So many other families ! <&&&> Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . <&&&> Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . <&&&> OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . <&&&> Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? <&&&> Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . <&&&> Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? <&&&> He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . Can you help me find a pan ? Can I help you with something ? <&&&> I need to cancel one of my accounts . <&&&> Is there a problem with it ? <&&&> I don ’ t need it anymore . <&&&> What would you like to do with all the money in this account ? <&&&> Just transfer it over to my remaining account . <&&&> I can do that . <&&&> That would be great . did you go to university ? <&&&> yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University . <&&&> when did you graduate ? <&&&> just a few years ago . What about you ? <&&&> I just graduated from high school . <&&&> are you planning on going to university ? <&&&> I'd like to get a BA , but I don't know where I should go . <&&&> have you applied anywhere yet ? <&&&> yes , I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them . <&&&> congratulations ! Which one is the cheapest ? <&&&> the tuition is the same for all of them . <&&&> which one has the most interesting course ? <&&&> I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . <&&&> where would you like to be located ? <&&&> I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . <&&&> have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? <&&&> not yet . Johnny , I can't believe you would do that . <&&&> I know , Grandma , I just ... <&&&> You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! <&&&> Yes'm . <&&&> You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! <&&&> Yes'm . <&&&> And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! What else can I do for you today ? <&&&> Well , I've been browsing online , but I ’ m not really sure what to do about payment . I would like to know what the most convenient way to do it is . <&&&> We'll have our own Secure Internet Banking Service . What it is , is a sort of online financial service for enterprises and individuals , so you could get it . It's for doing all types of e-business . Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ? <&&&> Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now . <&&&> Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ? <&&&> I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ? <&&&> Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side . <&&&> Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ? <&&&> Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it . <&&&> Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ? <&&&> Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it . <&&&> Oh , that will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry . Can I take a bus there ? Do you know Sally ? <&&&> Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . <&&&> Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock . Good morning . Can I help you ? <&&&> I want an American breakfast with fried eggs , sunny side up . <&&&> What kind of juice do you prefer , sir ? <&&&> Grapefruit juice and please make my coffee very strong . <&&&> Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs , sunny side up , grapefruit juice and a black coffee . Am I correct , sir ? <&&&> Yes , that's right . <&&&> Is there any thing else , sir ? <&&&> No , that's all . <&&&> Good morning , sir . I've brought the breakfast you ordered . <&&&> Just put it on the table , please . <&&&> Do you need anything else , sir ? Well , how does it look ? <&&&> It's a perfect fit . <&&&> Let me pay for it now . <&&&> Cash , credit card , or debit card ? <&&&> I think I'll use my credit card . Are you done ? <&&&> Yes . <&&&> Let me see . Everything looks fine . We ’ ll be taking applications for this position through Friday . We ’ ll start calling for interviews sometime next week . <&&&> So can I expect to hear from you to set up an appointment for an interview sometime next week ? <&&&> That ’ s right . <&&&> Thank you very much . Bye-bye . Do you have a foreign tour ? Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? <&&&> Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . <&&&> Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . <&&&> The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . R :: Good morning . Room Reservations .

Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? <&&&> Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . <&&&> How often do you run your anti-virus program ? <&&&> I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . <&&&> Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? <&&&> How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . Hi . This is a Receptionist Desk . How can I help you ? <&&&> Yes .

A single room is 120 dollars American , per night . <&&&> Fine . <&&&> And when would you like the rooms ? <&&&> From the 25th to the 28tri of September . <&&&> Arriving the 25th of September and leaving on the 28th ? Three nights ? <&&&> That's right . <&&&> Just a minute please . Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . <&&&> Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . <&&&> Show me some classic high heels , please . <&&&> Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? <&&&> Black . Classic . <&&&> Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . <&&&> Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . <&&&> OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . <&&&> I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for . <&&&> What size ? Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ? <&&&> Well , I'd like to buy a watch . <&&&> Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ? <&&&> Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ... <&&&> How about this one ? It's graceful in style . <&&&> Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> How much is it ? <&&&> 500 dollars , Madam . Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? <&&&> No , I assure you . <&&&> And you'll repair the television , won't you ? <&&&> Ok . <&&&> Do you promise ? <&&&> Of course . He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? Hello , Anna speaking ! <&&&> Hey , Anna , this is Jason . <&&&> Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ? <&&&> Yes . How are you , Anna ? <&&&> I am fine . What have you been doing ? <&&&> Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion . Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? <&&&> Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . How do we do timesheets here ? <&&&> They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? <&&&> Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? <&&&> Alright . Do you have a coin ? <&&&> Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . <&&&> Heads . <&&&> Sorry , it's tails . You lose . <&&&> Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . <&&&> Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? <&&&> No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . <&&&> Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . <&&&> Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? <&&&> Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? <&&&> Yes , I agree . <&&&> So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . <&&&> Alright . <&&&> I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . <&&&> Is that right ? <&&&> Yes , that's right . <&&&> Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . <&&&> Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . <&&&> Are all lucky people so stuck up ? <&&&> C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . <&&&> Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . do you have a minute ? <&&&> sure , what would you like to discuss ? <&&&> I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . <&&&> well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? <&&&> I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . <&&&> can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? <&&&> oh , no . not at all . <&&&> are you planning on studying abroad ? <&&&> no , sir . <&&&> have you been given a better offer ? <&&&> Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . <&&&> well , what's the problem then ? What can I do for you ? <&&&> I am trying to find this book . <&&&> What ’ s the problem ? <&&&> It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . <&&&> Have you checked the computer ? <&&&> I have already . <&&&> What did it say ? <&&&> It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . <&&&> I can always borrow the book from another library . <&&&> You can do that ? Hey , look out ! <&&&> What happened ? You ’ re free to leave . <&&&> I ’ m so excited . <&&&> What are you planning on doing now ? <&&&> I ’ m going back to college . <&&&> What are you going to major in ? <&&&> I haven ’ t thought about it yet . <&&&> I don ’ t want to see you back here . <&&&> You won ’ t see me here again . <&&&> I don ’ t think this place is for you . <&&&> I know . <&&&> I wish you luck . How ’ s it going ? <&&&> Great . Thank you . <&&&> What can I help you with ? <&&&> I need to cancel a check . <&&&> What ’ s wrong with the check ? I feel terrible sick , miss . I wonder if I could change my seat to the front part . <&&&> Please wait a moment .. I am sorry right now there is no vacant seat . I have to ask . <&&&> Thank you . Are you married ? <&&&> Yes , I've just married . <&&&> How long have you been married ? <&&&> I have been married for three years . <&&&> How many people are there in your family ? What did you do at the office today ? <&&&> I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . <&&&> What kind of things did you need to check ? <&&&> The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the <&&&> I see . Did anything else happen ? <&&&> I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required <&&&> It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . <&&&> Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . Ah ! No ! Damn it ! <&&&> It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . <&&&> So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . <&&&> Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? <&&&> No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . <&&&> I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . <&&&> I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . <&&&> What are we going to do now ? <&&&> I don't know . I feel like going out . <&&&> I wonder how much of the city is down . <&&&> It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . <&&&> Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . <&&&> But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football !

Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ? <&&&> I certainly have the will but I wonder if I've found the way . <&&&> You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar . <&&&> Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you . <&&&> I understand . <&&&> Do you ? Then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . What can you do to help ? <&&&> I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 . <&&&> All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ? <&&&> Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement . Hello .

Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? <&&&> Sure . <&&&> How did the business trip go ? <&&&> Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . <&&&> I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! <&&&> I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! <&&&> Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . Can I still catch T107 for Xiamen ? <&&&> Sorry , sir . The train has already left . <&&&> That's too bad . Can I take another train ? Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage . <&&&> Yes , Mary ? <&&&> We'd like you to come to work for us . <&&&> Oh .

I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . <&&&> It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . <&&&> It certainly is . It's so much fun . <&&&> I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? <&&&> Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . <&&&> Well , every stamp has a story to tell . <&&&> You're right .

It ’ s very interesting . <&&&> Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? <&&&> They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . <&&&> Why do they go there ? <&&&> Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . <&&&> When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . <&&&> That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . <&&&> I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . <&&&> That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . <&&&> Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . <&&&> Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . <&&&> Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday . <&&&> yes , you sent them to New York , right ? <&&&> that's right .

My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . <&&&> we have plenty of postcards to choose from here .

I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . <&&&> yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . <&&&> how much do they cost ? <&&&> the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? <&&&> yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . David , would you like something to eat ? <&&&> No , I'm full . <&&&> Do you want something to drink ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like some coffee . <&&&> Sorry , I don't have any coffee . <&&&> That's OK . I'll have a glass of water . <&&&> A small glass , or a big one ? <&&&> Small please . Hi , may I get you anything to drink ? <&&&> Yes , please . May I get a glass of lemonade ? <&&&> Would you like an appetizer ? <&&&> May I get an order of barbeque wings ? <&&&> Sure , would you like anything else ? <&&&> That'll be fine for now , thank you . <&&&> Okay , tell me when you want to order the rest of your food . <&&&> Excuse me . I'm ready to order . <&&&> What would you like ? <&&&> Let me have the baby-back ribs . Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . Is that your phone ? <&&&> yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? <&&&> it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? <&&&> yes , it's got wireless Internet access . <&&&> that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? <&&&> yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? <&&&> no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . <&&&> yes , I guess I should try to use it . Good afternoon ! <&&&> Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? <&&&> I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? <&&&> Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? <&&&> Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . <&&&> Yes . <&&&> What's the weather like in your country ? <&&&> Mm ... It's quite warm now . <&&&> Where do you live ? Have you a full-day trip ? <&&&> Yes , of course . There are various forms of travel . <&&&> Do I have to book the tour right now ? In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . <&&&> Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . <&&&> Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . Good morning , sir . How may I help you ? <&&&> Good morning ! Do you have any rooms available at the moment ? <&&&> Yes , we do . What kind of room would you like ? <&&&> I'd like a suite for four nights . Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station ? <&&&> Do you live in Pasadena ? <&&&> My house is up in Altadena . <&&&> You could always take the 264 . When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ? <&&&> We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? <&&&> Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . <&&&> Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . <&&&> I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away . <&&&> I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . <&&&> I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . Can I help you , sir ? Oh ! <&&&> What fools we were ! <&&&> To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . how are you doing ? <&&&> I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . <&&&> what happened to him ? <&&&> he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . <&&&> was it his first offence ? <&&&> unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . <&&&> what happened to him then ? <&&&> not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . <&&&> did they take his license away ? <&&&> no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . <&&&> what do you think will happen to him ? Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ? How can I help you today ? Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . May I help you ? <&&&> Could I check out this book ? <&&&> Let me see your library card . <&&&> I need to get one . <&&&> You can apply for one right now , if you ’ d like . <&&&> Okay . Let me do that right now . Can I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . <&&&> What kind of presents do you want ? <&&&> Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? <&&&> OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . <&&&> Hey , How did you know I came from America ? <&&&> Just a hunch , sir . <&&&> How much again ? <&&&> $ 59.95 . <&&&> That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . <&&&> Sorry , sir . <&&&> Why not ? Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? <&&&> No . What ? <&&&> He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . <&&&> No . Really , what happened ? <&&&> Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . <&&&> Was he out with the guys from the bank ? <&&&> Yes , I think so . <&&&> Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . <&&&> Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . <&&&> Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I'd like to get this prescription filled . <&&&> No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed . Hello , is that John ? <&&&> Yes . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I am calling to tell you some issues about the interview . How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America ? <&&&> Oh , I make a phone call once a month . <&&&> It's very expensive , right ? <&&&> Yeah . How about the working hours ? <&&&> From 9 to 12 a . m . , and 2 to 6 p . m . <&&&> Can I ask for a leave ? <&&&> Of course , if necessary . <&&&> Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ? <&&&> Seldom . Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? <&&&> We can take a bus there . <&&&> Does this bus go there ? <&&&> I think so . <&&&> Let's step in , Dad . <&&&> No , it's too crowded . Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? <&&&> I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . <&&&> What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! <&&&> Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . <&&&> Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . Happy Birthday , Mary ! <&&&> Thank you . <&&&> Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . <&&&> What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ? <&&&> I had my own ways of finding out.It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt .

Have you heard about Alice and David ? <&&&> No , have they had another fight ? <&&&> No , they've got engaged . <&&&> You must be joking . Those two ? <&&&> Well , my dear , I didn't believe it either . But I got it straight from the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . <&&&> So when did this all happen ? <&&&> Last weekend , while they were on their ski trip . <&&&> Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? What a nice day ! <&&&> Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? <&&&> Great , let's go ! <&&&> Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . <&&&> Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop . Would you please take a seat over there ? There are some interesting magazines on the coffee-table . <&&&> Thank you . How long it take to get my son's hair cut ? <&&&> It shouldn't be long . Thirty minutes , tops . Are you in a hurry ? <&&&> No . I'm thinking that maybe I can get my hair shampooed . Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages . <&&&> Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you . <&&&> I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ? <&&&> Just fine . How is everything with you ? <&&&> Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? <&&&> I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch . <&&&> OK , next time you ’ re here . <&&&> That ’ s a deal . <&&&> I heard that you moved to Florida . <&&&> Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . <&&&> Tell me more . <&&&> The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . <&&&> Sounds great ! <&&&> I ’ m pretty happy living there . <&&&> I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . <&&&> I ’ Ve been to all of them . <&&&> I ’ m jealous . I ’ Ve never been to Florida . <&&&> The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World . <&&&> That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation . <&&&> I hope you do . And keep in touch , OK ? <&&&> I sure will . <&&&> Here ’ s my business card . Send me an email once in a while . <&&&> Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime . <&&&> Thank you . I ’ d better get going . I don ’ t want to be late for lunch . Mom would worry . <&&&> Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip . <&&&> Take good care of yourself , Mary . The May Day holiday is coming . Have you made any plan ? Are you going to stay here or go out for a traveling ? <&&&> I haven ’ t decided yet . But I may go out . <&&&> Where have you planned to go ? <&&&> I want to go to Shanghai , but I also want to visit Hainan . Shall we share a taxi ? <&&&> Where are you heading now ? <&&&> I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house . <&&&> Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? <&&&> That's the one . <&&&> You mean we'll share the taxi ? <&&&> Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? <&&&> Check out please . <&&&> You have stayed for 6 day.Here is your bill . <&&&> Here is the cash.Can you look after my baggage for a while ? <&&&> Surely of course . But you have to be back by 5 o'clock , otherwise we will charge you 10 $ . Good morning . I'd like to check out right now . <&&&> May I have your room number 。 Sir ? <&&&> Room 103 . <&&&> Just a minute , Sir.Are you Mr Wang from China ? There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . <&&&> What is a tornado warning ? <&&&> It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? <&&&> To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . May I help you , sir ? <&&&> Yes , I'd like to get some gas . <&&&> Regular or unleaded ? <&&&> Unleaded . My car is new . <&&&> How many gallons do you want ? <&&&> Fill it up . I will have a tour tomorrow . <&&&> All right . Shall I check the oil ? <&&&> Yes , please . <&&&> You're a quart low . Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? <&&&> I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? <&&&> I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . <&&&> Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . <&&&> Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . <&&&> But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? <&&&> Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . <&&&> I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? <&&&> That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . <&&&> Really ? <&&&> Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? <&&&> China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation <&&&> We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable <&&&> Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent <&&&> Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? <&&&> Sorry , I can't . I am busy . <&&&> What are you doing ? <&&&> I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . Whose handset sounds so beautiful <&&&> Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? <&&&> Are you able to compose music ? <&&&> No , not yet . Hello , I'd like to see Mr . Charles , the manager , please . <&&&> You don't make any prior appointment , do you ? <&&&> No . I haven't , but I'll take only a few minutes of his time . <&&&> Please tell your name , company and the nature of your business . <&&&> Yes . My name is Lin Tao , the director of Guangzhou Computer Corporation . <&&&> I see . Wait a minute , please . Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long <&&&> It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . <&&&> Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . <&&&> Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . <&&&> True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . <&&&> What is a tornado warning ? <&&&> It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . <&&&> Really ? In New Berlin ? <&&&> No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . <&&&> I understand . They think a tornado might come . <&&&> Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a " watch . " <&&&> And the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . <&&&> Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . <&&&> It's scary . <&&&> Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . <&&&> What do you mean " a loud train " ? <&&&> That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . <&&&> But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? <&&&> Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . <&&&> Why do you say that ? <&&&> The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . <&&&> Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . <&&&> Do you mean financially rewarding ? <&&&> Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ? <&&&> Yes , it is . What can I do for you ? <&&&> I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission . <&&&> Are they urgent , please ? <&&&> Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days . <&&&> Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days . <&&&> Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ? <&&&> Yes , I promise . Your document won't be broken or lost . All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier . It is reliable . <&&&> OK . I will send them now . <&&&> Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them . Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ? Liu , two days later , you will be in England . Don't you feel excited ? <&&&> Yes , of course . I can't wait to be there . Did you order the cake ? <&&&> Oh , I forgot . <&&&> Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . <&&&> I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . <&&&> Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” Hello ? <&&&> Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ? you look better today . How did your test go ? <&&&> much better than it did yesterday . <&&&> did you pass ? <&&&> I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! <&&&> you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . <&&&> thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . <&&&> you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ? Are you still at that work ? <&&&> Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job . The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? <&&&> It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . <&&&> Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? <&&&> Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... <&&&> Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . <&&&> You're dancing so well . <&&&> You dance beautifully too . <&&&> When did you learn to dance ? <&&&> In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? <&&&> It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . <&&&> How about tango ? <&&&> Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? good morning . How can I help you ? <&&&> I'd like to open a new account . <&&&> have you filled out an application form ? <&&&> yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? <&&&> yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? <&&&> yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? <&&&> yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . <&&&> that's very convenient . <&&&> it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? <&&&> yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? <&&&> the maximum is $ 1000 . <&&&> is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? <&&&> yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . <&&&> Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? <&&&> A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . <&&&> Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? <&&&> Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . <&&&> Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . <&&&> When will that be ? <&&&> Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . <&&&> You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . <&&&> That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? <&&&> Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? <&&&> I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . Is there anything I can do for you ? <&&&> I'm trying to choose a gift . <&&&> Did you have anything particular in mind ? <&&&> No , but I'd like to get something typical in this region . <&&&> Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some . I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? What is this ? I didn't order that . <&&&> I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ? hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? <&&&> part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? <&&&> oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? <&&&> sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . <&&&> cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! <&&&> yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . <&&&> that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? <&&&> of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? <&&&> Umm ... I think so . What's up ? <&&&> I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . <&&&> Really ? Are you OK ? <&&&> I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? <&&&> If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . <&&&> Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? <&&&> Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . <&&&> That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? So , John , what do you do for a living ? <&&&> I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? <&&&> It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . <&&&> Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? <&&&> News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . <&&&> Is there anything interesting ? <&&&> Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . Mary , why are you so tired ? <&&&> I go to the personnel market every day , and put a lot of energy into it . <&&&> Why don't you think about applying for a job on the Internet ? <&&&> On the Internet ? I have never tried that way . <&&&> Well , it's very convenient and very popular now . <&&&> So how to apply for a job on the Internet ? <&&&> Just get online and send your application through email to the employer . <&&&> But how can I know which employer is hiring ? Can I help you , sir ? Hello , so how are we feeling today ? <&&&> Things are going well for me , Dr . Smith . <&&&> Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical ? <&&&> Yes , I am applying for new health insurance , and I need a physical examination to qualify . Miss , may I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . <&&&> It's because of the view . <&&&> Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? <&&&> Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . <&&&> How many elevators are there ? <&&&> There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . <&&&> How about the car-park space ? <&&&> There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . <&&&> Any other facilities ? <&&&> Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . <&&&> What is the completion date ? The dinner is really rich . May I help you ? <&&&> Yes , I'm looking for Bob . What do you think of smoking ? <&&&> It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . <&&&> What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? <&&&> Stop producing cigarettes . <&&&> But that ’ ll affect the national economy . <&&&> That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . <&&&> How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ?

Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . <&&&> How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . <&&&> The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . <&&&> Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake .

And there also might be some legal consequences . <&&&> Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? <&&&> Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . <&&&> I didn't think about that .
